Musaeus and the version used by Tchaikovsky for his ballet. In this retelling, the Prince and Odette escape death from the hands of the evil sorcerer. The economic prose has the cadence and language of a folktale; each sentence is simple and straightforward, with every word in place like a string of fine pearls. Iwasaki's illustrations are the same highly-colored abstract watercolors that she used for Anthea Bell's retellings of The Red Shoes (1983) and The Little Mermaid (1984, both Neugebauer Pr). Those looking for a straight retelling of the ballet plot will be better served by Donna Diamond's Swan Lake (Holiday, 1980). This book is, instead, a fine folktale retelling that uses the familiar ballet as a springboard.Kay McPherson, Central Atlanta-Fulton Public Library<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Endless Summer: The Boys Next Door; Endless Summer (Romantic Comedies)</h2><p>Two irresistible boys.

He shouted over the noise of the boat motor and the wind, &#x201c;Lori, when we&#x2019;re old enough, I want you to be my girlfriend.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t even care the other boys could hear him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m there!&#x201d; I exclaimed, because I was nothing if not coy. All the boys ate out of my hand, I tell you. &#x201c;When will we be old enough?&#x201d;<br> <br>His blue eyes, lighter than the bright blue sky behind him, seemed to glow in his tanned face. He answered me, smiling. At least, I <i>thought</i> he answered me. His lips moved.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t hear you. What&#x2019;d you say?&#x201d; I know how to draw out a romantic moment.<br> <br>He spoke to me again. I still couldn&#x2019;t hear him, though the boat motor and the wind hadn&#x2019;t gotten any louder. Maybe he was just mouthing words, pretending to say something sweet I couldn&#x2019;t catch. Boys were like that. He&#x2019;d just been teasing me all along&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;You ass!&#x201d; I sat straight up in my sweat-soaked bed, wiping away the strands of my hair stuck to my wet face. Then I realized what I&#x2019;d said out loud. &#x201c;Sorry, Mom,&#x201d; I told her photo on my bedside table. But maybe she hadn&#x2019;t heard me over my alarm clock blaring Christina Aguilera, &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t No Other Man.&#x201d;<br> <br>Or maybe she&#x2019;d understand. I&#x2019;d just had a closer encounter with Sean! Even if it <i>was</i> only in my dreams.<br> <br>Usually I didn&#x2019;t remember my dreams. Whenever my brother, McGillicuddy, was home from college, he told Dad and me at breakfast what he&#x2019;d dreamed about the night before. Lindsay Lohan kicking his butt on the sidewalk after he tried to take her picture (pure fantasy). Amanda Bynes dressed as the highway patrol, pulling him over to give him a traffic ticket. I was jealous. I didn&#x2019;t want to dream about Lindsay Lohan or getting my butt kicked. However, if I was spending the night with Patrick Dempsey and didn&#x2019;t even <i>know</i> it, I was missing out on a very worthy third of my life. I had once Googled &#x201c;dreaming&#x201d; and found out some people don&#x2019;t remember their dreams if their bodies are used to getting up at the same hour every morning and have plenty of time to complete the dream cycle.<br> <br>So why&#x2019;d I remember my dream this morning? It was the first day of summer vacation, that&#x2019;s why. To start work at the marina, I&#x2019;d set my clock thirty minutes earlier than during the school year. Lo and behold, here was my dream. About Sean: check. Blowing me off, as usual: noooooooo! That might happen in my dreams, but it wasn&#x2019;t going to happen in real life. Not again. Sean would be mine, starting today. I gave Mom on my beside table an okay sign&#x2014;the wakeboarding signal for <i>ready to go</i>&#x2014;before rolling out of bed.<br> <br>My dad and my brother suspected nothing, ho ho. They didn&#x2019;t even notice what I was wearing. Our conversation at breakfast was the same one we&#x2019;d had every summer morning since my brother was eight years old and I was five.<br> <br>Dad to brother: &#x201c;You take care of your sister today.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brother, between bites of egg: &#x201c;Roger that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad to me: &#x201c;And you watch out around those boys next door.&#x201d;<br> <br>Me: (Eye roll.)<br> <br>Brother: &#x201c;I had this rockin&#x2019; dream about Anne Hathaway.&#x201d;<br> <br>Post-oatmeal, my brother and I trotted across our yard and the Vaders&#x2019; yard to the complex of showrooms, warehouses, and docks at Vader&#x2019;s Marina. The morning air was already thick with the heat and humidity and the smell of cut grass that would last the entire Alabama summer. I didn&#x2019;t mind. I liked the heat. And I quivered in my flipflops at the prospect of another whole summer with Sean. I&#x2019;d been going through withdrawal.<br> <br>In past years, any one of the three Vader boys, including Sean, might have shown up at my house at any time to throw the football or play video games with my brother. They might let me play too if they felt sorry for me, or if their mom had guilted them into it. And my brother might go to their house at any time. But <i>I</i> couldn&#x2019;t go to their house. If I&#x2019;d walked in, they would have stopped what they were doing, looked up, and wondered what I was doing there. They were my brother&#x2019;s friends, not mine.<br> <br>Well, Adam was my friend. He was probably more my friend than my brother&#x2019;s. Even though we were the same age, I didn&#x2019;t have any classes with him at school, so you&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d walk a hundred yards over to my house for a visit every once in a while. But he didn&#x2019;t. And if I&#x2019;d gone to visit him, it would have been obvious I was looking for Sean out the corner of my eye the whole time.<br> <br>For the past nine months, with my brother off at college, my last tie to Sean had been severed. He was two years older than me, so I didn&#x2019;t have any classes with <i>him</i>, either. I wasn&#x2019;t even in the same wing of the high school. I saw him once at a football game, and once in front of the movie theater when I&#x2019;d ridden around with Tammy for a few minutes after a tennis match. But I never approached him. He was always flirting with Holly Chambliss or Beige Dupree or whatever glamorous girl he was with at the moment. I was too young for him, and he never even thought of hooking up with me. On the very rare occasion when he took the garbage to the road at the same time I walked to the mailbox, he gave me the usual beaming smile and a big hug and acted like I was his best friend ever... for thirty heavenly seconds.<br> <br>It had been a long winter. <i>Finally</i> we were back to the summer. The Vaders always needed extra help at the marina during the busy season from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Just like last year, I had a job there&#x2014;and an excuse to make Sean my captive audience. I sped up my trek across the pine needles between the trees and found myself in a footrace against my brother. It was totally unfair because I was carrying my backpack and he was wearing sneakers, but I beat him to the warehouse by half a length anyway.<br> <br>The Vader boys had gotten there before us and claimed the good jobs, so I wouldn&#x2019;t have a chance to work side by side with Sean. Cameron was helping the full-time workers take boats out of storage. He wanted my brother to work with him so they could catch up on their lives at two different colleges. Sean and Adam were already gone, delivering the boats to customers up and down the lake for Memorial Day weekend. Sean wasn&#x2019;t around to see my outfit. I was so desperate to get going on this &#x201c;new me&#x201d; thing, I would have settled for a double take from Adam or Cameron.<br> <br>All I got was Mrs. Vader. Come to think of it, she was a good person to run the outfit by. She wore stylish clothes, as far as I could tell. Her blonde pinstriped hair was cut to flip up in the back. She looked exactly like you&#x2019;d want your mom to look so as not to embarrass you in public. I found her in the office and hopped onto a stool behind her. Looking over her shoulder as she typed on the computer, I asked, &#x201c;Notice anything different?&#x201d;<br> <br>She tucked her pinstriped hair behind her ear and squinted at the screen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m using the wrong font?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Notice anything different about my boobs?&#x201d;<br> <br><i>That</i> got her attention. She whirled around in her chair and peered at my chest. &#x201c;You changed your boobs?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>showing</i> my boobs,&#x201d; I said proudly, moving my palm in front of them like presenting them on a TV commercial. All this can be yours! Or, rather, your son&#x2019;s.<br> <br>My usual summer uniform was the outgrown clothes Adam had given me over the years: jeans, which I cut off into shorts and wore with a wide belt to hold up the waist, and T-shirts from his football team. Under that, for wakeboarding in the afternoon, I used to wear a one-piece sports bathing suit with full coverage that reached all the way up to my neck. Early in the boob-emerging years, I had no boobs, and I was touchy about it. Remember in middle school algebra class, you&#x2019;d type 55378008 on your calculator, turn it upside down, and hand it to the flat-chested girl across the aisle? I was that girl, you bi-yotch. I would have died twice if any of the boys had mentioned my booblets.<br> <br>Last year, I thought my boobs had progressed quite nicely. And I progressed from the one-piece into a tankini. But I wasn&#x2019;t quite ready for any more exposure. I didn&#x2019;t want the boys to treat me like a girl.<br> <br>Now I did. So today I&#x2019;d worn a cute little bikini. Over that, I still wore Adam&#x2019;s cutoff jeans. Amazingly, they looked sexy, riding low on my hips, when I traded the football T-shirt for a pink tank that ended above my belly button and hugged my figure. I even had a little cleavage. I was so proud. Sean was going to love it.<br> <br>Mrs. Vader stared at my chest, perplexed. Finally she said, &#x201c;Oh, I get it. You&#x2019;re trying to look hot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;<i>Thank</i> you!&#x201d; Mission accomplished.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a hint. Close your legs.&#x201d;<br> <br>I snapped my thighs together on the stool. People always scolded me for sitting like a boy. Then I slid off the stool and stomped to the door in a huff. &#x201c;Where do you want me?&#x201d;<br> <br>She&#x2019;d turned back to the computer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got gas.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh, goody. I headed out the office door, toward the front dock to man the gas pumps. This meant at some point during the day, one of the boys would look around the marina office and ask, &#x201c;Who has gas?&#x201d; and another boy would answer, &#x201c;Lori has gas.&#x201d; If I were really lucky, Sean would be in on the joke.<br> <br>The office door squeaked open behind me. &#x201c;Lori,&#x201d; Mrs. Vader called. &#x201c;Did you want to talk?&#x201d;<br> <br>Noooooooo. Nothing like that. I&#x2019;d only gone into her office and tried to start a conversation. Mrs. Vader had three sons. She didn&#x2019;t know how to talk to a girl. My mother had died in a boating accident alone on the lake when I was four. I didn&#x2019;t know how to talk to a woman. Any convo between Mrs. Vader and me was doomed from the start.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, why?&#x201d; I asked without turning around. I&#x2019;d been galloping down the wooden steps, but now I stepped very carefully, looking down, as if I needed to examine every footfall so I wouldn&#x2019;t trip.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch out around the boys,&#x201d; she warned me.<br> <br>I raised my hand and wiggled my fingers, toodle-dee-doo, dismissing her. Those boys were harmless. Those boys had better watch out for <i>me</i>.<br> <br>Really, aside from the specter of the boys discussing my intestinal problems, I enjoyed having gas. I got to sit on the dock with my feet in the water and watch the kingfishers and the herons glide low over the surface. Later I&#x2019;d swim on the side of the dock upriver from the gasoline. Not <i>now</i>, before Sean saw me for the first time that summer. I would be in and out of the lake and windy boats all day, and my hair would look like hell. That was understood. But I wanted to have clean, dry, styled hair at least the <i>first</i> time he saw me, and I would hope he kept the memory alive. I might go swimming <i>after</i> he saw me, while I waited around for people to drive up to the gas pumps in their boats.<br> <br>The richer they were, the more seldom they made it down from Birmingham to their million-dollar vacation homes on the lake, and the more likely they were complete dumbasses when it came to docking their boats and finding their gas caps. If I covered for their dumbassedness in front of their families in the boats by giggling and saying things like, &#x201c;Oh sir, I&#x2019;m so sorry, <i>I&#x2019;m</i> supposed to be helping <i>you</i>!&#x201d; while I helped them, they tipped me beyond belief.<br> <br>I was just folding a twenty into my back pocket when Sean and Adam came zipping across the water in the boat emblazoned with VADER&#x2019;S MARINA down the side, blasting Nickelback from the speakers. They turned hard at the edge of the idle zone. Three-foot swells shook the floating dock violently and would have shaken me off into the water if I hadn&#x2019;t held on to the rail. Then the bow of the boat eased against the padding on the dock. Adam must be the one driving. Sean would have driven all the way to the warehouse, closer to where they&#x2019;d pick up the next boat for delivery.<br> <br>In fact, as Sean threw me the rope to tie the stern and Adam cut the engine, I could hear them arguing about this. Sean and Adam argued pretty much 24/7. I was used to it. But I would rather not have heard Sean complaining that they were going to have to walk a whole extra fifty yards and up the stairs just so Adam could say hi to me.<br> <br>Sean jumped off the boat. His weight rocked the floating dock again as he tied up the bow. He was big, maybe six feet tall, with a deep tan from working all spring at the marina, and a hard, muscled chest and arms from competing with Adam the last five years over who could lift more poundage on the dumbbell in their garage (Sean and Adam were like this). Then he straightened and smiled his beautiful smile at me, and I forgave him everything.</p><h2>The Bestseller</h2><p>The author of The First Wives Club offers a novel of romance and revenge about the vicious competition among five would-be authors to ascend the publishing world on the wings of their first best-seller. Reprint.</p><p>For anyone pondering a career in publishing, <i>The Bestseller</i>--a fictional account of the frayed egos, sorted ideas, and strange economics that fuel the book industry--may be a dose of harsh reality. Olivia Goldsmith has created a tale of Davis &amp; Dash, a Manhattan house run by an unspectacular publisher and a talented, but foul, editor. The new line of books doesn't exactly threaten to populate the Pulitzer list, though there's a serious 1,114-page work by a novelist who killed herself after her 23rd rejection letter. Goldsmith, who obviously deserves to be among the published, manages to puzzle these disparate pieces together into a cohesive story of the powers that be and those that hope to.<p>Olivia Goldsmith is the bestselling author of <em>The First Wives Club, Flavor of the Month, Fashionably Late, The Bestsller, Marrying Mom,</em>and <em>Switcheroo.</em> She lives in south Florida and is no longer young or a wife.</p></p><h2>My Dancing White Horses, The Autobiography of Alois Podhajsky</h2><p>The autobiographpy ofColonel Alois Podhajaky Director of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna.</p><p></p><h2>Thanks to My Mother</h2><p>In a poignant autobiographical account, a child gratefully thanks her mother who, by the use of her wits and courage, managed to keep her alive throughout their long period of imprisonment at the Vilinius ghetto and concentration camps during World War II.</p><p>HER MOTHER'S COURAGE KEPT HER ALIVE.<p>Susie Weksler was only eight in 1941 when Hitler's forces invaded her Lithuanian city of Vilnius.

President Thomas Jefferson shared this dream. He conceived the Corps of Discovery to travel up the Missouri River to the Rocky Mountains and westward along possible river routes to the Pacific Ocean. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led this expedition of 1804&#x2013;6. Along the way they filled hundreds of notebook pages with observations of the geography, Indian tribes, and natural history of the trans-Mississippi West. <p>This volume includes Lewis's and Clark's journals beginning in August 1803, when Lewis left Pittsburgh to join Clark farther down the Ohio River. The two men and several recruits camped near the mouth of the Missouri River for five months of training, acquiring supplies and equipment, and gathering information from travelers about the trip upriver. They started up the Missouri in May 1804. This volume ends in August, when the Corps of Discovery camped near the Vermillion River in present-day South Dakota.</p></p><p>Gary E. Moulton is Thomas C.

You just need to be willing to break the rules.</b><br><br>At nineteen, I founded a software company with $119 in my bank account. Five years later, it was valued at $10.5 million. I don't consider myself exceptionally brilliant. I just realized something few people know: You don't need lots of money or an original idea to get really rich. <br><br>Now, I make more than $100,000 in passive income every month, while also running my own private equity firm and hosting <i>The Top Entrepreneurs</i> podcast, which has more than 10 million downloads. This book will show you how I went from college dropout to member of the New Rich. And I'm holding nothing back. You'll see my tax returns, my profit and loss statements, my email negotiations when buying and selling companies. <br><br>It's time to forget your grandfather's advice. I'll teach you how to be a modern opportunist--investor, entrepreneur, or side hustler--by breaking these four golden rules of the old guard:<br><br>1.Focus on one skill: Wrong. Don't cultivate one great skill to get ahead. In today's business world, success goes to the multitaskers.<br>2.Be unique: Wrong. The way to get rich is not by launching a new idea but by aggressively copying others and then adding your own twist. <br>3.Focus on one goal: Wrong. Focus instead on creating a system to produce the outcome you want, not just once, but over and over again. <br>4.Appeal to the masses: Wrong. The masses are broke ($4k average net worth in America?). Let others cut a trail through the jungle so you can peacefully walk in and capitalize on their hard work.<br><br>By rejecting these defunct rules and following my unconventional path, you can copy other people's ideas shamelessly, bootstrap a start-up with almost no funding, invest in small local businesses for huge payoffs, and reap all the benefits.</p><p>Nathan Latka is the principal of Latka Capital; executive producer and host of The Top Entrepreneurs podcast; and CEO at two companies he's recently purchased.

Three years ago she was skeptical when I chose to drop out of school. Her message changed from &#x201c;Stay in school!&#x201d; to &#x201c;Get a will!&#x201d; More on me later. . . .<br>Let&#x2019;s talk about you first.<br><br>You know those people whose lives you just can&#x2019;t figure out? They travel the world whenever they want. They barely work. They&#x2019;re always with their family, or conquering the kind of grand life adventure you&#x2019;ve reserved for . . . <i>someday. </i>Somehow, they&#x2019;re happy with their life as it is&#x2014;not just hiding behind a &#x201c;perfect life&#x201d; fa�ade on social media.<br><br>There&#x2019;s the kid from your college dorm who dropped out and has since raised $1M in start-up funding. The dad you see at your son&#x2019;s soccer games, or at your gym, who drives a Range Rover and is always around in the middle of the week when most parents are working. Your neighbor who quit her corporate job and now has her own business that you hear is making her $10K or $20K a month.<br><br>You know these people are average at best. They&#x2019;re not supertalented or smart, but they&#x2019;re living like kings and queens and you&#x2019;re dumbfounded.<br><br>What they know that you don&#x2019;t is how to be a capitalist without any&nbsp;capital.

And the people you&#x2019;re thinking about have mastered breaking those rules.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s easy to dismiss the superrich as trust-fund babies, or to assume their spouse is the breadwinner. Or we think maybe they&#x2019;re not rich at all and just racking up credit card debt. These scenarios will be true for some people, but I&#x2019;m not talking about them.<br>I&#x2019;m talking about the people who are wealthy by their own doing. Their families have nothing to do with their fat bank accounts. You can&#x2019;t stand their weekday Instagram posts from their sailboat, or the sight of them on another overseas vacation, but as much as they annoy you, you&#x2019;re also dying to know how they do it. How are these people so successful&#x2014;and free&#x2014; while you&#x2019;re withering away underneath fluorescent lights at your desk job 50+ hours a week?<br><br>It&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re part of the &#x201c;New Rich,&#x201d; as Tim Ferriss calls the segment of the population who have figured out how to maximize everything in their life&#x2014;even if it&#x2019;s not much&#x2014;so it becomes an asset that works for them. The New Rich are resourceful with their time, their money, and their energy. They get what they want when they want it. They travel however much they want. They have blank calendars. And they have very, very few expenses.<br><br> Tim Ferriss introduced us to the New Rich over a decade ago in his book <i>The 4-Hour Workweek, </i>but a lot has changed since then<i>. </i>Today my peers and I are getting rich not just by starting companies from scratch, but by leveraging gold mines like Instagram and Airbnb that didn&#x2019;t exist in the early 2000s. We drive wealth by taking advantage of new tools quickly and figur- ing out how to get those tools to work for us so we can work less.<br><br> When an average person sees a new rich person, they assume that new rich person has some magical quality. It&#x2019;s not magic. The average person just doesn&#x2019;t understand how the rich person got so rich, so they explain it away as &#x201c;magical.&#x201d; A magician practices a series of &#x201c;moves&#x201d; or &#x201c;tactics&#x201d; behind a curtain so that when the trick is put together, the average viewer misses the sleight of hand. If you saw the magician practicing behind the curtain, you&#x2019;d think, &#x201c;I can pull that trick off, too!&#x201d; Building wealth is the same.<br><br>These magicians practice behind the curtain, but I&#x2019;m holding back nothing in this book. I&#x2019;ve been a wealth magician for the past decade, and despite my lawyer&#x2019;s recommendations, I&#x2019;m sharing everything in this book so you can pull off your own &#x201c;wealth magic.&#x201d; You&#x2019;ll see my tax returns, my<br>profit and loss statements, my email negotiations when buying and selling companies. I&#x2019;m sharing it all so you can study and get a very real sense of how I&#x2019;ve built my empire. I&#x2019;ll take you behind the curtain of the New Rich so you can become part of the inner sanctum.<br><br>The lifestyle you want is not out of your reach&#x2014;you just don&#x2019;t know the moves yet. This book will lead you through those moves, starting with some I began making at the age of nineteen. You&#x2019;ll learn how to replicate the inner workings of more than twenty revenue streams I now have at twenty-nine years old.<br><br>If you&#x2019;re ready to join the New Rich, read on, my new wealth magicians!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> MY STORY AND WHY YOU NEED THIS BOOK <b>&nbsp;<br></b><br> There are a few things you should know about me:<br> &nbsp;<br> � I&#x2019;m a college dropout.<br> � I started my first company in my Virginia Tech dorm room when I was twenty. Within four years I hired forty people and grew the company to $5M in sales and a $10.5M valuation.<br> � I walked away from a $6.5M acquisition offer for that company when I was twenty-three.<br> � I don&#x2019;t have a r�sum�.<br> � I bought my first piece of real estate on my own when I was twenty-four.<br> � I bought my first company when I was twenty-six.<br> � Today, at twenty-nine years old, I run my own private equity firm, buying and selling companies.<br> � I use patterns and data to drive my decisions.<br> &nbsp;<br> That last detail is probably the reason I&#x2019;ve gotten this far, and it&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m going to help you get here, too. I&#x2019;m not going to waste your time with small talk and rah-rah positivity. If you&#x2019;re familiar with my podcast, <i>The Top Entrepreneurs</i>, you already know this about me. I have interviewed more than five hundred of the world&#x2019;s top thinkers, disrupters, and CEOs in search of patterns that anyone can apply to gain wealth, work less, and get what they want out of life. I get to the data and I get to the numbers so you and I can learn from the real stuff. In fact, I pressure these CEOs so hard, they share&nbsp;secret strategies they wish they didn&#x2019;t share, and threaten to sue after their episode goes live. Their fault! (Your gain!) An unfortunate side effect is that I&#x2019;m the most sued podcaster&#x2014;you should see my wall of cease and desist letters (a beautiful thing! I always win these contests!).<br><br>This book is a natural extension of my podcast. I will present the secrets of the New Rich and feature real stories from twenty-year-old dorm-room CEOs, Airbnb millionaires, filthy rich software founders, and financial technology billionaires&#x2014;all of whom are building their wealth every day, right now. We&#x2019;ll get their stories, but just as important, we&#x2019;ll look at the real numbers behind their businesses so we can understand how they make it work.<br><br>Then there are the patterns. In all my time talking to top entrepreneurs, I&#x2019;ve noticed that their execution plans follow similar patterns that counter conventional business wisdom. These patterns directly correlate to wealth, freedom, and a lot of winning&#x2014;and they&#x2019;ll surprise the hell out of you. Once you learn about them in the chapters ahead, you&#x2019;ll realize building wealth is so easy it&#x2019;s unbelievable, and you&#x2019;ll join those rich friends whose success baffled you just a few months earlier.<br><br> My obsession with numbers is so fierce that it&#x2019;s the reason I dropped out of college. That, and the money-smart mindset my mom has instilled in me since before my memories kicked in. She swears that during a car ride when I was five years old I asked her why we never went out to dinner anymore. She explained that she and my dad had to make choices. They&#x2019;d recently decided to move our family into a new, big house in the country. Since making that choice, they had to choose not to spend money on other things, like eating out.<br><br>I sat quietly in the back seat for a long time. Then I said, &#x201c;So, Mom, can I choose to get into my piggy bank and take us out to Pizza Hut tonight?&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t take me up on it. Instead, she and Dad chose to take us out to dinner that evening, but the lesson was clear.<br><br> I have no memory of this conversation, but when I hear the story it says so much about how my parents raised me to think like an entrepreneur. Mom wasn&#x2019;t talking about the family budget that day&#x2014;not exactly. Her bigger point was that you have to make choices based on the life you want to live now&#x2014;and the life you want to live in the future. It&#x2019;s all about opportunity cost. Sometimes that means less pizza in exchange for the big coun- try house (except when your five-year-old breaks your resolve in a two-minute conversation). Other times it means following your gut when&nbsp;you see a big opportunity in front of you, even if it goes against everything you&#x2019;re told you&#x2019;re &#x201c;supposed to be doing&#x201d; with your life.<br>That&#x2019;s where I found myself when I decided to drop out of college. I stayed until my junior year, but I&#x2019;ll never forget the moment I realized school wasn&#x2019;t for me. It was during a statistics course very early on in my time at Virginia Tech. I should have loved this class, but the teacher was so boring and I had other things on my mind.<br><br> The midterm that semester was my wake-up call. I&#x2019;d stayed up the night before preselling a Facebook fan page product I&#x2019;d just launched. I was very tired, but I&#x2019;d sent out $1,400 in sales proposals that night, so I had no regrets. I had set up a ping on my phone so it would make a sound every time a new PayPal sale came in. My phone was across the room during the test, but I heard it ping twice in the two-hour exam period. I was selling my product at $700 a pop, so I made $1,400 before the exam was done. I failed it, but that failure turned into unstoppable momentum to keep growing my business.<br><br> I realized I was a capitalist the moment I got those failed test scores. I thought, If I can fail this exam and make $1,400 while doing it, school is just not my thing. I stuck with it a couple more years but I knew I had to get out and build my company. If you&#x2019;re a student reading this, keep going. It gets even better . . .<br><br>When I finally did decide to leave school, one of the first things I did was call Mom. I thought she&#x2019;d be livid with me for wanting to quit&#x2014;especially after she&#x2019;d worked three jobs to pay her own way through college. Now my parents were paying my tuition, and there I was, throwing it away. But she wasn&#x2019;t angry at all. She just told me it was my choice, but I should think about my options. It was the only time in my life when my parents would pay for me to go to college (I was fortunate and thankful), so she suggested I finish my degree in case one of my business ventures failed down the line.<br><br>She had a point, but I knew I&#x2019;d never push myself to be successful if I had that safety net under me. I told her I just had to go.<br><br>Mom said she knew she&#x2019;d raised three stubborn, ambitious kids, so she wasn&#x2019;t going to stand in the way of what we wanted to do. She just pushed me to consider my choices before jumping.<br> All I could think about were the numbers. I knew I could go way bigger than $1,400 in an afternoon if I put more time and energy into my business. Forget the rules, or what anyone said I should be doing with my life at twenty years old (thanks, Mom, for not being one of those people). I saw my opportunity and I was going for it.</p><h2>Strike the Blow for Freedom: The 6th United States Colored Infantry in the Civil War</h2><p>Details the regiment&#39;s recruitment, training, and contributions</p><p></p><h2>The Royal Family: A Novel</h2><p><b>A rich, haunting novel of street life in San Francisco&#x2019;s Mission District, from the National Book Award-winning author of<i> Europe Central</i></b><br><br>In&nbsp;<i>The Royal Family</i>, William T. Vollmann uses the story of two brothers to construct a haunting series of parallels between the lives of the dispossessed and the anxious middle class. Henry Tyler is a failing private detective in San Francisco. When the love of his life, Irene--who happens to be married to his brother John, an ambitious contract lawyer--commits suicide, he clings despairingly to her ghost. Struggling to turn his grief into something precious, Henry enters into a new life of nightmare beauty and degradation as he attempts to track down the legendary Queen of the Prostitutes.<br><br>Crafted out of language by turns eloquent, humorous, sensual, and obscene, and full of vividly rendered depictions of low-life bars, office politics, and hobo camps, here are Vollmann's familiar but ever surprising characters--the seekers, the vigilantes, the hypocrites, the sex workers. He has woven their stories into a vivid and unforgettable novel about the eerie paradoxes of possession and loss.</p><p>By the standards of the street, Henry Tyler is a good man, kind to hookers and the homeless, skilled at avoiding fights. He'd be the first to admit that his job as a private investigator is unsavory, and he turns away many prospective clients by suggesting that they may not want to hate their spouses any more than they already do. The love of his life, to his regret, is his brother's sweet, conventional wife, Irene. Henry's brother John, in almost black-and-white contrast, is cold and professional, all his yearnings focused on becoming full partner in his law firm. He manages to distance himself emotionally from everything but his mother and the hand-painted Italian silk ties that signify success to him. Although not overly fond of his wife, he resents Henry's longing for her, which seems to typify everything sloppy and extravagant in his brother's nature, everything that marks him as a loser.<p> On this classic framework William Vollmann has hung a gargantuan novel, by turns satiric, philosophical, lyrical, and baroque. It is a song of San Francisco. Rarely has a city been explored so tenderly and ruthlessly, from the mansions of Pacific Heights to the flophouses of the Tenderloin. In one of his many loving set pieces, Vollmann sends Henry Tyler through the streets surrounding Union Square, where a Peruvian quartet is playing to some weary tourist ladies. </p><blockquote> Their lives were passing, vacations trickling through the hourglass; moment by moment this warmish blue San Francisco day was being wasted. They sat beneath lush palm-trees, and distantly a trolley-car sounded its bell as he heard the ladies talking about grilled-cheese sandwiches; then he was past them and could not hear anymore. </blockquote> Tyler spots a gray-haired man digging in a garbage can. Near him, "reflected palm-tendrils swerved and curved in the windows of Macy's, and skyscrapers' terraces swelled and bowed there as if in the throes of an immense explosion. The Peruvians' music, gentle and strangely liquid, seemed the appropriate solvent for this image of dissolution." <p> When Irene--pregnant and neglected--kills herself, John disappears into his work while Henry, in a quest that parallels the course of his grief, devotes himself to the Queen of the Whores, a dark saint who protects the lowest of the low. It makes all the difference that our Virgil for this journey to the underworld is this good-natured and observant man, whose physical appetites never overwhelm his sympathy for the addicted and exploited. Henry remains firmly on the side of good, even when the boundaries blur before his eyes. At times, the author invites identification with his big-hearted hero, as when he veers into an agitated, first-person essay on the judicial evil of bail. Beat-flavored, with touches of Rabelais, C�line, and, oddly, T.S. Eliot, <i>The Royal Family</i> is Vollmann's most ambitious work to date, and a noisy, compelling world in itself. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>William T.

Each book in the series includes: an insightful introduction to the important historical, literary, and theological issues; key terms and phrases from the translation highlighted in the commentary where they are discussed; explanations of special Greek or foreign terms; references to important primary and secondary literature; and a Scripture index.Second Corinthans is one of the most difficult writings in the New Testament to interpret. Yet, this commentary, which follows Barrett&#39;s works on Romans and I Corinthians in the same series, is superb in every respect. The author&#39;s command of the Greek language, his skillful use of the Old Testament and background writings, and his sensitive handling of complex exegetical problems provide a panorama of a mature scholar&#39;s work which is at times almost breathtaking. Moreover, the restrained use of Greek and technical terms makes this commentary as useful for the layman or pastor as it is for the scholar. Review and Expositor</p><p>C. K. Barrett is Emeritus Professor of Divinity at the University of Durham. He is especially known for having authored numerous scholarly articles and books, including <i>Commentary on St. John, The First Epistle to the Corinthians, The Second Epistle to the Corinthians</i> (Black's New Testament Commentary), and <i>The New Testament Background: Selected Documents.</i><p></p>"It is clear. . . . that we are here under the guidance of one who is not only an expert scholar but also an experienced commentator."<br>&#x2014;The Expository Times<p>"These [the Corinthian letters and Romans] are among the greatest of New Testament writings and Barrett is among the greatest of present day commentators.

Yet Kate is intrigued to discover the mysterious documents have been stolen.<br><br>While eccentric villagers buzz with sightings of strange lights and ghostly apparitions around Rose Cottage, Kate uncovers a web of family resentment, jealousy, and revenge as tangled as the rambling vines in its garden. The twisted trail leads to a stunning revelation that opens the door to her own shrouded past--and an unexpected chance at love. . . .</p><p>Mary Stewart launched a world full of romance readers, and she invented romantic suspense. In this beautifully written gothic, Kate Herrick, a young widow in war-torn London, returns to her family home of Rose Cottage to retrieve family mementos for her Gran. When Kate arrives, she finds that the mementos have mysteriously disappeared. While looking for answers to age-old family mysteries (her single mother supposedly ran off with gypsies) Kate rekindles friendships with neighbors, kinsman, and old childhood companions. The bittersweet memories that Kate examines help her to redefine herself as a widow and as a young woman with a great need for family ties.<br>"The mistress of suspense-romance."<br>--The New York Times<br><br>"A RARE TREAT . . .

Her ambitions to be a New York state trooper dashed by a male dominated bureaucracy, she became a wife and mother but was curious about lost persons she read about in the newspaper. This curiosity led her to join the Adirondack search and rescue team. She participated in many rescues throughout the United States, but her search skills were largely unmentioned in press accounts of the rescues. Eventually, she applied for and received a private investigator's license. Along the way, readers experience Greene's personal obstacles, especially the task of locating her own runaway teenage son. This is not the stuff of TV crime storiesno fast action stake-outs, car chases, or guns. These are true life stories that may or may not have a happy ending. Anne Paget, Episcopal High School, Bellaire, Tex .<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.In relating the story of how Greene came to make a career of searching for missing persons, the authors also provide commentary on the media hysteria that has evolved from a seemingly national paranoia over abducted children. They maintain that most often missing young persons are like Greene's own son at one time, runaways who "want us to find them and bring them home." Chronicled are cases that have taken Greene all over the country, noting successes in finding runaway minors, children spirited away by a parent or relative and missing adults who regret disappearing, cases often given low priority by police. A divorced mother of two with family problems, Greene surmounted prejudices against her to gain recognition in the male-dominated world of the private investigator. Altruism and perseverance are ingredients of her career tale.

Authored by noted architectural scholars Alberto P�rez-G�mez and Juhani Pallasmaa as well as the preeminent architect Steven Holl, the three separate essays are thematically linked: each one tries to explain the role human perception and phenomenological experience play in architecture. In particular, Holl -- who was named by Time magazine as the most important architect of his generation and the designer of the much-lauded Chapel of St. Ignatius at Seattle University and the highly anticipated Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art addition -- lucidly explicates the importance of intuition in the construction and experience of built space. Holl explains his search for phenomenological experience thus: &#34;To open architecture to questions of perception, we must suspend disbelief, disengage the rational half of the mind, and simply play and explore. Reason and skepticism must yield to a horizon of discovery.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Keys to American History: Understanding Our Most Important Historic Documents</h2><p><p>Unlock and explore American history firsthand though this nation&#x2019;s most important documents.

The 72 entries range chronologically from the foundation of the American colonies with the Great Patent of James I in 1606 to the 2002 Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces in Iraq. The volume documents such monumental episodes as the American Revolution, Civil War, Western Expansion, World War II, and the Civil Rights Movement. It contains all of the documents one would expect, such as the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and Gettysburg Address as well as the lesser-known Antiquities Act of 1906, which protects historic national sites. Each document is prefaced with a brief introduction that gives students a reasonable degree of historical context. The author also includes a "What They Were Saying" segment that utilizes quotes of the day related to the documents. Each entry is accompanied by a variety of black-and-white portraits, maps, and facsimiles of the originals. While arguments will abound for the many documents left out, one cannot deny the seminal historical importance of those making the cut.

For anyone concerned with the Civil War and the history and culture of black Americans, here is a richly complex, multifaceted chronicle of a neglected chapter in America's history.<br><br>In The Negro's Civil War, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James McPherson assembles key extracts from newspaper articles, books, speeches, and letters, and allows black preachers and doctors, former slaves and intellectuals, soldiers and educators to speak for themselves. Through their words, we learn of conditions for blacks in the Union army, the rebuttal of the theory of racial inferiority, and the shift in black views of Lincoln. And we hear of the aspirations of a newly freed people to acquire education, suffrage, and, above all, the human dignity that had long been denied them. For this edition, McPherson has added a searching new foreword bringing the book up to date.</p><p>The experiences of blacks differed greatly from those of white during America's Civil War. In the North, against great opposition, black soldiers--when given the opportunity--fought valiantly on behalf of the Union. The South was a different story. Aside from life on the plantation, many slaves followed their masters to war, and on occasion fought for the Confederacy. There was also, of course, the underground railroad, helping escaped slaves to freedom. Pulitzer Prize-winning author James McPherson paints a stunning picture of the other side--the Negro's Civil War. If you've read BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM, you must read this book to get the full picture.<br><br>Doug Grad, Editor&#x201c;McPherson shatters the belief that [blacks] were passive about their freedom.

P. Lovecraft and the Paperback era of P. K. Dick, and arguably, is as influential as both these authors. From a historical context, Leiber in fact knew both of the authors, and his work can be seen as a bridge connecting the many different flavors of genres of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Edited by award-winning editors Jonathan Strahan and Charles Brown, this new collection of the grand master&#39;s fiction covers all facets of his work, and features an Introduction by Neil Gaiman and an Afterword by Michael Chabon.</p><p><p>Fritz Leiber is considered one of science fiction's legends. Author of a prodigious number of stories and novels, many of which were made into films, he is best known as creator of the classic Lankhmar fantasy series. Fritz Leiber has won awards too numerous to count including the coveted Hugo and Nebula, and was honored as a lifetime Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America. He died in 1992</p>Starred Review. The versatility of SFWA Grand Master Leiber (1910&#x2013;1992) is ably demonstrated by these 17 superb stories, each of which has wonder blazing at its core. Smoke Ghost places a classic ghost story in a modern urban setting, while the dread in Coming Attraction reflects the uneasiness of the cold war. The powerful Gonna Roll the Bones explores man's compulsion toward self-destruction, while a different archetype is revealed in The Girl with the Hungry Eyes, which reveals the vampiric seduction of modern consumerism. There are three tales of adventurous rogues Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, including the Nebula Award&#x2013;winning Ill Met in Lankhmar, in which youthful derring-do leads to heart-wrenching tragedy.

Owing as much to the rhythmic constructions of jazz as to established methods of scholarship, Thompson plays a riff on biology and culture seeing the birth of the mind in Proust&#x2019;s Madeleine, the displacement of humanity in Christo&#x2019;s wrapping of the Reichstag and, in Lao Tzu&#x2019;s <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, the path forward to a new planetary culture.

The memory of this journey will haunt him for the rest of his life. On this trip, he meets the enigmatic Cousin Aubrey, a man of "irregular kinship," the black sheep of the Longfort clan. As the years pass, and Aubrey disappears into the world, Nathan begins to compulsively collect rumors about his faraway life&#x2015;as Nathan's mother's first true love, a charmer of European society, a Don Juan, a worldly success&#x2015;and sees it in stinging contrast to his own unfulfilled dreams of becoming an artist.

A Tennessee native, he had lived in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his wife, poet Eleanor Ross Taylor.</p>Taylor (The Oracle at Stoneleigh Court, 1993, etc.) has written a novel that reads like a stream-of-conscious autobiography, sprinkled with wonderful moments but without the sustaining power fiction requires to propel it. ``In the Tennessee country of my forebears it was not uncommon for a man of good character suddenly to disappear,'' begins Nat Longfort, the elderly narrator. An art critic and historian, Nat is obsessed with the fate of affluent Tennesseeans who set off on paths differing from those of their old families. Specifically, the memory of his mother's ``disappeared'' illegitimate cousin, Aubrey Tucker Bradshaw, haunts Nat, as do the ghosts of the genteel Confederate-era South. Throughout his life, Nat sees the mysterious Aubrey at family funerals and can only guess at what his cousin's life has become outside of the tight, although widespread, Taylor clan. Aubrey and Nat's mother nearly eloped when very young, and after their break, his mother suppressed all of her artistic inclinations, passing on her desires to her son. Nat himself had to make the difficult decision of whether to become a painter or an art critic. Meanwhile Nat's own son also is faced with the difficulty of making his way as an artist. There are many sly, humorous set pieces involving old Southern families and the academic life, and there are some wise and beautifully written epiphanies on the nature of art and love, yet the book is for the most part a rambling, repetitive hodgepodge of stories and themes that never quite coheres into a whole, despite the tidy and well- wrought ending. At times vintage Taylor--warm, evocative, and darkly humorous- -but it doesn't really hold up as a novel. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Using a refreshingly simple approach, Paul Collicutt has crafted the perfect book for young railroad enthusiasts. Each page features a vividly colored and detailed painting of a train, and the spreads show how they are different -- long and short, fast and slow, old and new. As a bonus, full-color endpapers feature captioned renderings of real-life engine models from all over the world that were the inspirations for the trains depicted throughout the book.</p></p><p>Paul Collicutt is an author, illustrator, lecturer, and graphic novelist. He lives in Sussex, England.PreSchool-Collicutt presents pictures of an international assortment of trains: Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Canadian, French, and North American. Simply worded, sparse text printed in large letters provides commentary on the vivid paintings. Each pair of illustrations on facing pages contains a concept, ranging from the basic ("This train is yellow. This train is red") to the sophisticated ("This train runs on steam. This train runs on electricity"). The bright, full-color art is simple and bold, and the endpapers give the name and country for each model featured. This title accomplishes many things: it's a concept book for preschoolers, a beginning reader, and a source of information for primary-grade train fans. This very successful presentation concentrates on the vehicles themselves, excluding the people who run and ride them.

Among them were Thomas Gray, whose great &#39;Elegy&#39; might never have been published without Walpole&#39;s encouragement; that &#39;laughter-loving dame&#39; Kitty Clive, the greatest comic actress of her day; Lady Suffolk who entertained Walpole with stories of the days when she was George II&#39;s mistress; the epicene John Chute, whose architectural knowledge and enthusiasm helped to inspire Strawberry Hill; the gentle Berry sisters, who comforted Walpole&#39;s old age; George Selwyn, celebrated for his wit, languor, and necrophilia. &#39;If Mr Selwyn calls&#39;, said Mr Fox on his death-bed, &#39;show him up.

Reprint.</p><p>Grade 7-10-- Take an almost perfect teenage girl and have her notice a bumbling but talented artistic boy and combine them with time-travel, ESP, and medieval witchcraft and lore. The result is a Julian Thompson cast in a Margaret Mahy plot. There is, no doubt, an audience for fantasy that seems grounded in this contemporary reality of high school and single-parent households. Yet Dylan's artistic abilities and Juniper's telepathic powers never take on reality. The time traveling that takes the daring young woman into medieval times and the visions that she sends her friend to sketch never quiver or seem subject to any human failings. Even the trappings that could help readers buy into the fantasy, such as Juniper's completely medieval room, seem artificial. Real life, on the other hand is very hard--so difficult that breezy competent Juniper panics just crossing a shallow ford, and fails to realize that her popular boyfriend is a jerk--until he almost kills her. Dylan's home life is such a disaster that readers will wonder where he gets the energy to receive Juniper's mental images of another time and to render his perfect drawings. Jordan's fiery ending pulls together threads of story and, without dodging or prettifying, provides that climax to which all the earlier suspense has been leading. This is the best part of the book, and, while melodramatic, it has a genuineness and excitement that satisfies. It almost makes the book worthwhile. But not quite. --Carol A. Edwards, Buckham Memorial Library, Faribault, MN<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.A 14-year-old finds herself psychically linked with a young woman who was burned as a witch in medieval England. Juniper, whose wide interests include reincarnation and time travel, drags feckless Dylan Pidgley into her experiments with telepathy because he is a marvelous artist and can draw the scenes she transmits. Some of these are from the past-- experiences of a young mother and herb-wife, Joanna. Juniper's mother warns Dylan that Juniper can be heedless, but Dylan is too fascinated by Juniper and by his own vision of Joanna's plight to withdraw. Events rush to a conclusion as Joanna is tried by the ordeal of water and then burned, with Juniper in danger of being pulled into a 20th-century parallel. Fortunately, Juniper and Dylan together find the strength to shield Joanna from the agony of her burning. With vividly depicted, believable characters, this is superior fantasy. Though Dylan is drawn like a moth to Juniper's flame, she soon realizes that he has a strength and grace that her sexier, older boyfriend lacks. Playing their drama against the death of a young woman in the past--whose love of knowledge resembles Juniper's, but whose quest leads to tragedy rather than love--gives the story poignancy and depth.

For this revised and expanded edition of her celebrated COOKING A LA CORDON BLEU, Alma Loch has retained her straightforward approach to the elegant cuisine of Paris and added an entirely new section covering the hearty regional foods of the French Provinces. HOW AND WHYS OF FRENCH COOKING is much more than a collection of recipes. Mrs. Lach explains as clearly as possible the logical system by which the French cook performs. She encourages her readers to master the system and then move away from set recipes to their own imaginative refinements. This approach elevates the cook from the everyday task of feeding the family to the artistic realm of creation. There are hundreds of splendid, easy-to-follow recipes in the book--all of them authentically French. She explains how to use substitute ingredients when necessary, and provides a wine recommendation for each main dish (and American wines are included). The ingredients for each recipe are listed in order of use, and procedures are given in numbered steps. Each basic recipe is followed by a number of delightful variations. In the all-new section on provincial cooking Mrs. Lach has prepared menus and recipes that represent the favorite foods of more than 30 regions of France. Many of the recipes are for one dish meals and casseroles--ideal for busy American cooks. These meals are served with French bread, cheese, and fruit, and the beverage is wine, cider, or beer, depending on the province.</p><p></p><h2>Memoirs of an Amnesiac</h2><p>The memoirs of the world-class pianist, composer, television &amp; radio star, and film personality.

It is a name we have been forced to reckon with in five years of building Commonwealth Editions as a publisher of nonfiction books about New England and its historic places. Edward Rowe Snow. Everywhere we heard the name&#x2014;from readers, from booksellers, from historians, from other authors. Nowhere we saw the books. <p>Not new books, anyway. New editions of Snow weren&#x2019;t anywhere to be found. Snow&#x2019;s out of print, we were told. Hasn&#x2019;t been in print for fifteen years. Love to see him in print, booksellers told us. People ask for his books all the time. </p><p>We found fan clubs devoted to Edward Rowe Snow and catalogs and web sites filled with used copies of his books. More than once we heard the joke that a first edition of his work is more valuable unsigned than signed: Snow was such a tireless promoter of his own work, so willing to sign books anywhere on any occasion, that the unsigned book is rare indeed. </p><p>We could not find his books, but we found his legend everywhere. It seemed to us that half of New England had grown up "at the feet" of Edward Rowe Snow, taking in his tales like mother&#x2019;s milk or a good bowl of chowder on a cold, stormy day. And booksellers virtually begged us to reissue Snow&#x2019;s books. Ken Gloss of the legendary Brattle Book Shop in Boston was typical: "Not a week goes by," he told us, "that I don&#x2019;t get a request for a book by Edward Rowe Snow." Or maybe he said day. </p><p>It was Gloss who finally tipped us off to the whereabouts of the one person on earth who literally grew up at the feet of Edward Rowe Snow. Dorothy Snow Bicknell, an extraordinarily kind and gentle woman known to what must be countless friends as "Dolly," is Snow&#x2019;s daughter and only child. On a cold November day, we met Dolly at the South Shore Mall, where a model "Lighthouse Santa" still pays tribute to Snow. She charmed us with her devotion to her father&#x2019;s memory. And I like to think she recognized Commonwealth Editions as a publisher that could do justice to that memory. </p><p>With Dolly we met Jeremy D&#x2019;Entremont, who proved to be much more than a passionate fan of Edward Rowe Snow (we already knew plenty of those). As knowledgeable as he is dedicated, Jeremy provided the key to this new centennial edition of Snow&#x2019;s work&#x2014;by respectfully updating and, here and there, gently correcting the master&#x2019;s work. At the end of each chapter are Jeremy&#x2019;s notes, which bring Snow&#x2019;s text to the present day. It is too bad there are no lighthouse keepers anymore, because Jeremy D&#x2019;Entremont was born for the work. A beacon kept lit with his discernment and devotion would keep vessels safe in the severest weather, on the craggiest shore. </p><p>Snow partisan Bob Jannoni provided encouragement for this new edition, and designer Judy Barolak gave it grace and dignity. Bill Stokinger of the Metropolitan District Commission provided photos and reviewed the text. Steve Csipke developed a new, thematic index. One other person is worthy of note. Our managing editor, Penny Stratton, pulled together with Dolly and Jeremy and the many talented contributors and, against all odds, brought this new edition of Edward Rowe Snow to port. All involved with this project have been invigorated by the spirit and legend of Edward Rowe Snow. </p><p>Webster Bull<br> Commonwealth Editions Publisher<br> Summer 2002</p>Edward Rowe Snow (1902-1982) was descended from a long line of sea captains. He sailed the high seas, toiled aboard oil tankers, and worked as a Hollywood extra&#x2014;all before attending college. Later he worked as a teacher and coach, and as a reconnaissance photographer during World War II. His education and work prepared him well for his legendary writing career, which was part maritime history, part show business. <p>The Islands of Boston Harbor, his first book, was published in 1935. In all, Snow wrote nearly one hundred books and pamphlets, illustrated with many of his own photographs. He also contributed newspaper columns to the Quincy Patriot Ledger, the Boston Herald, and the Brockton Enterprise. In the 1950s his radio show "Six Bells" was heard on dozens of stations, and he made many other appearances on radio as well as on television. </p><p>Snow is fondly remembered as the "Flying Santa." For forty years he flew in small planes and helicopters over the lighthouses of New England, dropping Christmas parcels for the keepers and their families. His efforts to preserve the islands of Boston Harbor as public lands are less well known. After his death in 1982, the Boston Globe lauded his support for conservation: "There are many political leaders and environmentalists who can justly share the credit for the preservation of the harbor islands, but among them Mr. Snow will hold a special place as a link to their past and a guide to their present." </p><p>Snow married Anna-Myrle Haegg in 1932. They had one daughter, Dorothy Caroline Snow (Bicknell), two granddaughters, and one great-grandson. The young people who grew up "at his feet," reading and listening to his tales of New England maritime history, are countless.</p></p><h2>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</h2><p>This full-color 40th anniversary edition of Roald Dahl&#x2019;s most popular novel features vibrant spot art by Quentin Blake on candy-colored pages enhanced by candy-filled borders.

But what happens when the children, one by one, disobey Mr. Wonka?</p><p><i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> and its sequel, <i>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</i>, along with Roald Dahl's other tales for younger readers, make him a true star of children's literature. Dahl seems to know just how far to go with his oddball fantasies; in <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,</i> for example, nasty Violet Beauregarde blows up into a blueberry from sneaking forbidden chewing gum, and bratty Augustus Gloop is carried away on the river of chocolate he wouldn't resist. In fact, all manner of disasters can happen to the most obnoxiously deserving of children because Dahl portrays each incident with such resourcefulness and humor. <p> <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> is a singular delight, crammed with mad fantasy, childhood justice and revenge, and as much candy as you can eat. The book is also available in Spanish (<i>Charlie y la Fabrica de Chocolate</i>). (The suggested age range for this book is 9-12, but nobody this reviewer has met can resist it, including New York City bellhops, flight attendants, and grumpy teenagers.)</p>What happens when the five luckiest children in the entire world walk through the doors of Willy Wonka&#39;s famous, mysterious chocolate factory? What happens when, one by one, the children disobey Mr. Wonka&#39;s orders? In Dahl&#39;s most popular story, the nasty are punished and the good are deliciously, sumptuously rewarded.</p><h2>Francais et Americains: L&#39;autre Rive (2nd French Edition)</h2><p>One of the many reasons why the Americans and the French, these two great people who nourish such complex feelings towards one another, have so much difficulty getting along consistently is that the Americans like to do and the French are content to understand. But this is not to say that such understanding comes easily. The author, a French-born and naturalized American with extensive experience of both countries, has attempted here not only to describe the surprisingly strong differences between our two cultures, but also to explain why we are so different. For this innovative work, he mobilizes a multi-disciplinary approach to a rare degree. He gives readers from either shore an opportunity to reflect, at a truly deep level, on their own culture, in order for us to finally be able to see what we were taking for granted and to unearth the many cultural roots of our personality.

She spent every spare moment for years--first as a law student, then as a lawyer--working on the book about Richard III.

Five excellent historical mysteries later, Penman has started a new series set even farther back in time. It&#39;s 1193, and King Richard has disappeared on his way back to England after fighting in the Crusades. Justin de Quincy, the well-educated but illegitimate son of a bishop, is tapped to search for the missing ruler, and he turns out to be just the chap to blow away the cobwebs that often hang over historical mystery.

Starting with the birth of the British upper-class in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the essays provide a significant and provocative assessment of the roles these dynastic families played in the evolution of Britain&#39;s financial, geographic, and industrial history. Along the way, Cannadine critically dissects and rehabilitates the lives of Winston Churchill, Harold Nicolson, and Vita Sackville-West. Cannadine&#39;s uniquely informed perspective brings a mixture of sympathy and detachment, skeptical interest, and ironic fascination to the continuing drama of the aristocracy in modern history.</p><p>David Cannadine has taught at Columbia University, New York, where he is now Moore Collegiate Professor of History.Cannadine (The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy, Doubleday, 1992) offers this set of "occasional pieces," written over the period 1977-93, which serve the purpose of filling in background for the larger work. The essays are divided into three sections: an overview of class issues in modern Britain; an examination of unusual examples of the aristocratic family unit, including the now-famous unorthodox marriage of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West; and a profile of less well known aspects of individuals' lives and careers. Included in this latter section are Lord Curzon's penchant for organizing ceremonial occasions, Lord Strickland's career in Malta and Tasmania, and the scandals of some of the less savory members of Winston Churchill's family. While they are most likely to appeal to those with some background in the subject matter, the essays are written in a lively style that should have broad appeal.

Tour.</p><p>From King (The Book of Reuben, 1994, etc), a departure from her familiar fictional environs (the small town of Nodd's Ridge), but a work sharing with her earlier books a decidedly unquaint view of domestic life in Maine. Kristin Mellors (a.k.a. ``Kissy Melons,'' for an obvious physical attribute) starts out the novel by almost killing two fellow students at Sowerwine College. Her car doesn't hit them, but soon after a vehicle driven by a drunk premed student does. One girl dies, the other falls into a coma. Kissy's relationship with the girl in a coma, Ruth Prashker, will haunt her for the rest of the story, as will her involvement with the drunk driver. An aspiring photographer, Kissy is a member of the college's black-clad artsy set, so it's a surprise when she takes up with the star of the school hockey team, Junior Clootie. But if sex is any indication (and it is the principal indication of practically everything here), the two are made for each other. Clootie is bound for the pros, but Kissy's future is less clear. Will she establish her independence from her past, or will the survivors of the accident she witnessed continue to dog her existence? Clootie truly loves her, but he's basically an amiable screw-up. Some ill-advised whoring lands both him and Kissy with the clap and sets a pattern: Clootie will always be trouble, and Kissy will always have trouble staying away. A bizarre tryst with the drunk driver/premed student leaves Kissy pregnant, and she marries Clootie, giving birth to a baby girl. Their marriage goes almost immediately to pieces, though, thanks largely to Clootie's indiscretions and nomadic lifestyle. The author's decision to tack on a conventional thriller ending is questionable, but it scarcely dilutes the impact of this rough-and-tumble, exceedingly realistic, and metaphorically resonant lurch through damaged lives. A novel of great insight and empathy, filled with believable, troubled, complex characters. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Departing from her usual literary territory of Nodd's Ridge, King (The Book of Reuben) moves onto a Maine campus to pit a strong yet vulnerable woman against her own demons as she struggles to extricate herself from a poisonous marriage. Talented photographer Kristin "Kissy" Mellors, 21, is poised to escape her hometown of Peltry, where she is finishing college, when a tragic accident freezes her in her tracks. Spotting two college girls in her headlights one night, Kissy slams on the breaks only to watch helplessly as the car behind her plows on and mows down the girls, killing one and leaving the other severely brain damaged. Traumatized, Kissy is compelled to photograph the comatose girl over and over. She finds herself inextricably bound to three men as well: Junior Clootie, a local hockey star who was the lover of the girl who died; James Houston, a wealthy premed student who was the drunk driver responsible for the accident; and Mike Burke, the first officer on the scene. Pregnant, Kissy marries Clootie (although Houston could be the father); but when his boozing and womanizing escalate into abusive behavior, she bails out, falling into a marriage with Burke. Rising from cop to assistant DA, the alcoholic Burke never loses his infatuation for Kissy, but theirs is a brutal, lifeless marriage. In a tough and gritty conclusion involving a breathtaking chase, Kissy starts making the right decisions after years of wrong choices, confronting Burke and regaining her own soul. King has created a compelling heroine in Kissy. Faltering yet determined to be brave, she captivates the reader just as a speeding car captivates the driver who desperately wants to get it under control. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mountain Man</h2><p>Tailored after the actual &#34;Crow Killer&#34; John Johnson, Sam Minard is a mountain man who seeks the freedom that the Rocky Mountains offers trappers.

Etulain is Professor of History at the University of New Mexico.</p><h2>Resemblances, amazing faces</h2><p>Charles Le Brun was a Frenchman who achieved prominence as an artist during the reign of Louis XIV; but it is his curious physiognomy studies and the &#34;scientific&#34; theories he evolved from them that are far more interesting to modern audiences than the vast allegorical paintings he contributed to Versailles, the Louvre, and other collections. The physiognomy studies illustrated a dissertation delivered by Le Brun before the Academy of Painters and Sculptors (of which he was a founding member), but unfortunately the notes that originally accompanied the drawings disappeared centuries ago. Scholars have pieced together-from the drawings and from other writings-the theories that Le Brun had worked out, and it is from their work that we are able to draw further conclusions. Le Brun&#39;s physiognomy studies are an offshoot of man&#39;s continuing fascination with the congruities that can be found between human and animal &#34;faces&#34; and our seemingly irresistible desire to equate physical features with personality.</p><p></p><h2>Elysian Fields (Sentinels of New Orleans, 3)</h2><p><p><i>Elysian Fields</i> by Suzanne Johnson is the fun, fast-paced third book in the Sentinels of New Orleans, a series of urban fantasy novels filled with wizards, mermen, and pirates.

It, plus the gun on his hip, offered a warning to anyone who might take a notion to rob him: don&#x2019;t.</p> <p>&#x201c;You owe me,&#x201d; he said, and he wasn&#x2019;t smiling.</p> <p>Homicide detective Ken Hachette had agreed to let us into his crime scene as a favor to Jake, his former Marine buddy who&#x2019;d recently trained to join a new FBI unit called the Division of Domestic Terror, or DDT.</p> <p>Ken didn&#x2019;t know the DDT&#x2019;s brand of domestic terror would involve the preternaturals that had flooded into New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina tore down the metaphysical levees between the modern city and the Beyond.

But this had been a last-minute gig and even a research geek like me knows when to take a shortcut.</p> <p>Ken unwrapped a stick of sugarless gum and rolled it up before popping it into his mouth. Then he folded the wrapper into a small, neat square and stuck it in his coat pocket. His face, the color of a deep, rich caramel, glistened with mist, and he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe it off. Who carried handkerchiefs? In our limited acquaintance, Ken had struck me as the type of man who might iron his boxer shorts and arrange his sock drawer by color.</p> <p>The anti-DJ, in other words.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, okay.

Much of the lower Quarter was residential, and surprisingly large Creole-style homes lay nestled behind the narrow street entrances.</p> <p>We crossed the slate pavers of an elegant courtyard edged with a jungle of banana trees and palms, and waited while Ken untied yet another length of yellow tape, this one barricading a set of French doors.</p> <p>&#x201c;Who was the victim?&#x201d; I closed my eyes while Ken fiddled with the tape and pulled out a key to unlock the house. I might be a wizard, but I had enough elven genes from both of my parents that I&#x2019;d won the freak lottery and ended up with some elven magic in my repertoire&#x2014;part of which was the ability to sense the presence of preternatural energy. The aura of anything inhuman that might have been out here in the courtyard, however, had dissipated into the mist.</p> <p>Warped as it sounded, I was praying for a nice, ordinary, human serial killer. I&#x2019;d barely recovered from an attack and near-drowning three weeks earlier at the hands of a psycho nymph, not to mention cracked ribs courtesy of overzealous merman CPR. Breathing remained a painful chore, and I really, really wanted Axeman Deux, as the media had dubbed the killer, to be Ken&#x2019;s problem.</p> <p>The detective rattled off the details in short, clipped phrases. &#x201c;Joseph Isaacson. Age fifty-seven. Owned a shipping-container company that does a lot of business with the port. Divorced. Lived alone. Same MO as the other attacks.&#x201d;</p> <p>The copycat murders had started two weeks ago, and tonight&#x2019;s was the third death. These attacks shared a lot with the original ones committed in 1918 and 1919 by a never-identified serial killer the newspapers had named the Axeman because of his chosen weapon. The assaults came late at night, death resulted from hard blows to the head with an ax while the victims slept in their beds, and the bloody weapon had been left propped against a door or kitchen counter at the scene as a gory souvenir.</p> <p>We entered the French doors into a parlor that could have served as a ballroom back when this place had been built in the early 1800s. It had been decorated in tasteful shades of cream, tan, and ivory, which made the puddle of blood next to an end table all the more gruesome.</p> <p>Jake knelt next to the blood and I followed his gaze to the droplets trailing crimson across the room and into a back hallway. How was the loup-garou inside him handling the blood? Jake had been withdrawn for the last few weeks&#x2014;since he&#x2019;d almost lost control on our one and only attempt at a real date, and again after my near-drowning.</p> <p>Nothing could kill a budding romance like having a guy threaten to go furry while you&#x2019;re making out on the sofa or stare down at you with flat yellow eyes and bared teeth as you lie helpless on the ground.</p> <p>Physically, Jake hadn&#x2019;t changed a lot since being turned loup-garou three years ago. His wiry runner&#x2019;s frame was more muscled, but he still had the laid-back exterior, the amber eyes, the sun-streaked blond hair, and the dimples. But the loup-garou tended to be violent loners, and Jake&#x2019;s control over his wolf was shaky. He&#x2019;d never embraced what he&#x2019;d become. We still flirted with each other a little, but in the last couple of weeks it had become hollow, as if done from habit rather than from heart.</p> <p>&#x201c;The ax was propped against the table here.&#x201d; Ken squatted next to Jake and pointed at a small cherry end table with delicate legs. &#x201c;The bedroom where the body was found is down that hall. This ax was the same as the others.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Any fingerprints?&#x201d; Jake asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Plenty&#x2014;but nothing that matches anything in our databases. He&#x2019;s not being careful about what he touches. He&#x2019;s taunting us.&#x201d;</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t like the sound of that. It could be a sloppy or arrogant human killer with no police record &#x2026; or a prete who knew nothing about forensics.</p> <p>They stood up, and Ken pointed to spots where little cardboard placards had been placed by the crime lab team. &#x201c;Look in those areas and see if you can find anything we missed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; Jake&#x2019;s eyes lingered on the pool of blood before he turned away and began canvassing the room.</p> <p>Had Jake&#x2019;s voice sounded a little shaky, or was I looking for trouble? My former cosentinel Alex Warin, an enforcer for the wizards and Jake&#x2019;s new boss on the DDT, thought this low-stress assignment would be a good test for his cousin. Alex was supposed to be on this field trip instead of me, gauging Jake&#x2019;s reaction to a bloody scene.</p> <p>When Alex had been called away to investigate a merman-weregator problem in one of the river parishes, I got drafted&#x2014;thus the late-night Axeman research.</p> <p>I was partly here to see if the murder had any prete connection, and also to see how Jake handled himself.</p> <p>There hadn&#x2019;t been anything to indicate preternatural involvement, but any copycat crime pushed my paranoid button these days. Since the borders between modern New Orleans and the Beyond had dropped last month, any old prete could wander into town without the fear of being escorted out of the modern world by the New Orleans sentinel&#x2014;namely, me.</p> <p>That included the historical undead, famous former citizens given immortality in the Beyond by the magic of human memory. I wanted to make sure Axeman Deux wasn&#x2019;t the real Axeman, come back in undead form to resume his murderous ways.</p> <p>I had more than a passing acquaintance with all the trouble that could be caused by a member of the historical undead. The undead pirate Jean Lafitte had initially come to my house to shoot me. I&#x2019;d visited his hotel room on business, only to find him interested in pleasure. We&#x2019;d shared boat rides, he&#x2019;d tried to impale me with a dagger, I&#x2019;d accidentally set him on fire with the ancient elven staff I call Charlie, and we&#x2019;d ventured back to 1850 to have a dinner date at Antoine&#x2019;s before getting assaulted by an elf.</p> <p>Yeah, it&#x2019;s a complicated relationship.</p> <p>While Ken and Jake looked at spots where the police had found minute bits of evidence&#x2014;hair and fibers that could have come from either the victim or the killer&#x2014;I pretended to study an antique vase and reached out with my senses.</p> <p>I usually wore my mojo bag, a pouch of magic-infused herbs and gemstones that blunts my empathic abilities, but I&#x2019;d left it off tonight. Whatever was here, I needed to pick up on it, whether it was residual energy from the Beyond or the fact that the blood scent made Jake&#x2019;s mouth water. Can I hear an ick?</p> <p>I ignored the wonky energy of loup-garou and filtered out the other sensory details: the quiet voices of the men as they talked about the crime, the drip of water off the leaves of the banana tree outside the doors, the iron-rich scent of blood, the muddy odor of wet concrete. There was nothing else here except human energy.</p> <p>That could be attributed to Ken, but it also didn&#x2019;t rule out the historical undead, whose energy read mostly human. By spending time around Jean Lafitte, I&#x2019;d learned the slight variation between the auras of regular humans and that exuded by the famous immortals.</p> <p>At least my time with the pirate hadn&#x2019;t been for nothing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay if I go back to the bedroom?&#x201d; I approached the guys, who were enthusiastically discussing carpet fibers.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Ken said. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>I threw up my hands. &#x201c;I know, don&#x2019;t touch anything.&#x201d;</p> <p>He smiled at that, and it took a decade off his face. &#x201c;Alex has said that to you a few times, I bet.&#x201d;</p> <p>Laughing, I walked down the hallway, avoiding the blood droplets on the polished wooden floors. I&#x2019;d met Ken shortly after Katrina, when Alex and I had just become cosentinels and were posing as a couple. I&#x2019;m not sure he&#x2019;d ever learned our true relationship. Not that I could even define it these days. Friends on the way to being &#x2026; something &#x2026; maybe &#x2026; or not.</p> <p>Yeah, that relationship was complicated too.</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t need to follow the bloody path to find the room where the murder had occurred; the stench of death led me to the second door on the right. The overhead lights had been left on, and thank God my stomach was empty so I was spared the humiliation of barfing at Ken&#x2019;s crime scene.</p> <p>A duvet covered in intricate gold and brown embroidery lay in a heap at the foot of the bed, exposing a bare mattress. The sheets and pillows were missing&#x2014;probably covered in blood and brain matter and taken by the cops. The top third of the mattress was soaked a deep crimson, and the spatter of red on the wall resembled some horrible Rorschach test.</p> <p>I went through my ritual again, filtering out extraneous sensory data, focusing on the room. Death, especially violent death, leaves behind a signature, but it was fading.</p> <p>The human aura was stronger. The place had been covered with cops. But underneath it all, like the high-pitched whine of a mosquito that&#x2019;s flown too close to one&#x2019;s ear, the not-quite-human energy of a member of the historical undead swept across my skin.</p> <p>Damn it. This wasn&#x2019;t going to be Ken Hachette&#x2019;s case. It was going to be mine.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2013 by Suzanne Johnson</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>100 Years of Oz: A Century of Classic Images</h2><p>Since its publication in 1900, The Wizard of Oz has remained in print, spawning 39 sequels, five silent movies, innumerable stage productions, a radio series, countless animated cartoons, and arguably the greatest MGM musical of all time. Conventions of Oz fans, held thrice yearly, draw upwards of 75,000 visitors. <p>For these fans-and anyone who ever dreamed of visiting Oz-Willard Carroll draws from his private collection of more than 10,000 museum quality pieces to offer a rare glimpse of Baum's beloved creations and their influence on popular culture. </p><p>Divided by decade, this book traces a century of Oz lithography, photography, sheet music, book jackets, stationery, manuscripts, costumes, film props, animation cells, newspaper rotogravure, greeting cards, Halloween masks, theater programs, contracts, maps advertising fliers, gams, toys, puzzles, dolls, and other memorabilia gathered from every corner of the world. With brilliant new photography, original artwork, drawings, sketches, blueprints, and stage and movie stills, 100 Years of Oz is a joyous and unique passport over the rainbow.</p></p><p><i>The Wizard of Oz</i> bears the remarkable distinction of being a perennial favorite in both book and movie form, the former for a solid century. Since the first <i>Wizard of Oz</i> book appeared just as the American merchandising machine was swinging into full gear, the characters of Oz have also been immortalized in a century's worth of memorabilia. In <i>100 Years of Oz</i>, John Fricke takes the reader through the remarkable history of L. Frank Baum's creation, lavishly illustrating the progression with pieces from Willard Carroll's Oz collection. This collection is in itself a stunning monument to one man's obsession, albeit a charming one. Once you get past the sheer enormity of the accumulation, though, the individual pieces themselves are well worth a look. They range from the expected, such as dolls and comic books, to themed peanut butter and "hangers from the Merrie Land of Oz." Posters, ads, and jacket covers from the many stage, film, and book versions of the Oz series from all over the world are also included and make for more lovely eye candy. <i>100 Years of Oz</i> is the perfect gift for hardcore Wizard aficionados, but it also gives the casual fan plenty to ogle, as well as a new appreciation of just how enduring this classic series has been. <i>--Ali Davis</i>WILLARD CARROLL is the writer and director of Playing by Heart, a Miramax film.

But be warned--if you are revisiting the delights held within these fuchsia covers, you may find it difficult to contain your glee. Recalling songs like "It's All Right to Cry" (sung by football star Rosie Greer on the original album), "Parents Are People," and of course, the titular "Free to Be... You and Me," may inspire irrepressible crooning.<p> This wondrous collection was created by Marlo Thomas and contains introductions by Gloria Steinem and Letty Cottin Pogrebin, stories and poems by Shel Silverstein, Judy Blume, Carl Reiner, Charlotte Zolotow, and Judith Viorst, among others, and an afterward by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. With such stellar contributors, it's not surprising that <i>Free to Be... You and Me</i> has won critical acclaim since its publication. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> notes that it "challenged racial, sexist, and economic stereotypes for children ... became a beloved national bestseller--and made it okay for boys to have dolls and girls to be good at sports." The <i>Washington Post</i> has called it "an immensely diverse and imaginatively arranged collection," while the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> deemed it "a positive, refreshing book for children and adults that tells you not who you should be ... but who you can be." Indeed, the concepts espoused by this book go beyond what is glibly referred to as "politically correct," and offer a simple, hopeful vision for humanity.</p><p> This reissue will appeal to people of all ages--those who remember reading it to their children and grandchildren in the 1970s, those who have fond memories of growing up with this book close at hand, and those who are exploring its illuminating content for the first time.

But thanks to award-winning author Georgeanne Brennan, we now know what makes the cuisine so delicious. Olives, anchovies, and capers are the secret ingredients behind the magical flavors of the Mediterranean. Toss a few tangy olives and capers, or a savory anchovy or two into these over 50 dazzling recipes and instantly capture the fresh, sun-drenched flavors of Italy, France, Greece, Tunisia, and Morocco. Enhanced by vibrant color photography, Brennan reveals the basic techniques for salting, brining, curing, and seasoning these delicacies and also explores their history and common uses. Bring the Mediterranean home with these simple, flavorful accents and add intensity and depth--with minimum effort--to any dish.</p><p>What gives Mediterranean food its characteristic savor? Olives, anchovies, and capers, asserts Georgeanne Brennan, whose eponymous book explores these fundamental ingredients as "secret" dish enhancers. Add chopped green olives to dishes like Almond Couscous with Carrot and Cumin Chicken, for example, and the subtle sweetness of the dish is delightfully complemented; anchovies do similar wonders in a potato salad with tuna; and capers add depth and nuance to a lamb stew with tomatoes and sweet peppers. The book explores the unique power of these humble ingredients, providing over 50 simple recipes that utilize the title ingredients to add flavor, or that feature them in delightful ways. Cooks at all skill levels should find the book a welcome key to a much-beloved culinary repertoire.<p> Beginning with short essays that explore the characteristics of olives, anchovies, and capers, and also providing instructions for home-curing (you may never put up olives or anchovies, but it's fascinating to know how it's done), the book then offers recipes in chapters devoted to appetizers and salads; main dishes and spreads; sauces and breads. There are many treasures, including Penne Salad with Three Herbs, Capers, and Tuna; Omelet of Tomatoes and Black Olives with Gorgonzola; and Roast Chicken with Mustard Anchovy Crust. Small in size, but not in the wealth of its information or fine taste, and illustrated with color photos throughout, <i>Olives, Anchovies, and Capers</i> brings the flavors of the Mediterranean home in new and exciting ways. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Georgeanne Brennan is a James Beard Award-winning author of numerous cooking and garden books.

With its back against the wall, NASA made an almost unimaginable leap: It would scrap its usual methodical approach and risk everything on a sudden launch, sending the first men in history to the Moon&#x2014;in just four months. And it would all happen at Christmas.<br><br> In a year of historic violence and discord&#x2014;the Tet Offensive, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy, the riots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago&#x2014;the Apollo 8 mission would be the boldest, riskiest test of America&#x2019;s greatness under pressure. In this gripping insider account, Robert Kurson puts the focus on the three astronauts and their families: the commander, Frank Borman, a conflicted man on his final mission; idealistic Jim Lovell, who&#x2019;d dreamed since boyhood of riding a rocket to the Moon; and Bill Anders, a young nuclear engineer and hotshot fighter pilot making his first space flight.<br><br> Drawn from hundreds of hours of one-on-one interviews with the astronauts, their loved ones, NASA personnel, and myriad experts, and filled with vivid and unforgettable detail, <i>Rocket Men</i> is the definitive account of one of America&#x2019;s finest hours.

He lives in Chicago.Chapter One<br><br>Do You Want to Go to the Moon?<br><br>August 3, 1968&#x2014;Four months earlier<br><br>As he sat on a beach in the Caribbean, a quiet engineer named George Low ran his fingers through the sand and wondered whether he should risk everything to win the Space Race and help save the world.<br><br>At forty-one, Low was already a top manager and one of the most important people at NASA, in charge of making sure the Apollo spacecraft was flightworthy.<br><br>Apollo had a single goal, perhaps the greatest and most audacious ever conceived: to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy had committed the United States to achieving this goal by the end of the decade. Never had a more inspiring promise been made to the American people&#x2014;or one that could be so easily verified.<br><br>Now, Kennedy&#x2019;s end-of-decade deadline was in jeopardy. Design and engineering problems with the lunar module&#x2014;the spidery landing craft that would move astronauts from their orbiting ship to the lunar surface and back again&#x2014;threatened to stall the Apollo program and put Kennedy&#x2019;s deadline, just sixteen months away, out of reach. And that led to another problem. Every day that Apollo languished, the Soviet Union moved closer to landing its own crew on the Moon. And that mattered. The nation that landed the first men on the Moon would score the ultimate victory in the years-long Space Race between the two superpowers, one from which the second place finisher might never recover.<br><br>For months, NASA&#x2019;s best minds had worked around the clock to fix the issues with the lunar module, but the temperamental and complex landing craft only fell further and further behind schedule. By summer, many at the space agency had abandoned hope of making a manned lunar landing by the end of the decade.<br><br>And then Low had an idea.<br><br>It had come to him just a few weeks before he&#x2019;d arrived at this beach, and it was wild, an epiphany, a dream. It was also dangerous, risky beyond anything NASA had ever attempted. But the more Low thought about it, the more he believed it could keep the Apollo program moving and save Kennedy&#x2019;s deadline&#x2014;and maybe even beat the Soviets to the Moon.<br><br>Low inhaled the fresh, salty air and tried to push space travel out of his thoughts. At home, his mind burned nonstop with ideas, formulae, trajectories. Now he needed a break, and it should have been easy to find one in this tropical paradise. About the only reminder of America was the local newspaper, which told of the Newport Pop Festival in Costa Mesa, California, where more than a hundred thousand music fans were expected, and brought word of potential protests at the coming Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It had been an explosive year already, with assassinations, riots, and violence. A quiet beach was just where a man like Low needed to be.<br><br>But Low could not relax. He walked the beach, looking out over the ocean toward Moscow and the Moon, thinking, imagining, America and the world on fire behind him.<br><br>Five days after Low returned from vacation, a serious man with an oversized head went to work inside a giant assembly plant in Downey, California. His mission: to build a machine from the future that would help make the world safe for democracy.<br><br>Over and over, astronaut Frank Borman opened and closed the hatch on the Apollo command module, a cone-shaped capsule made to fly a three-man crew to the Moon. He&#x2019;d already certified that the hatch worked, then certified it again, but he would not stop pushing on it, making sure it opened, no matter what.<br><br>Nearby, Borman&#x2019;s two crewmates, Jim Lovell and rookie Bill Anders, got ready to test the hundreds of dials, switches, levers, lights, and gauges that made the command module work. The spacecraft was small, measuring just eleven feet tall and thirteen feet wide at its base, but every inch of it had been designed by Borman and others to be impervious to a galaxy of deadly forces.<br><br>A nearby transistor radio played Top 40 music, which caught Borman&#x2019;s ear.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a pretty slick song,&#x201d; Borman said. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the fella singing it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Beatles, Frank,&#x201d; Lovell said, laughing.<br><br>Borman preferred the standards. As a kid, he&#x2019;d memorized the lyrics to all the great Western songs played on the radio in Arizona. He could still sing &#x201c;Cowboy Jack&#x201d;&#x2014;a ditty that dated to the nineteenth century&#x2014;but didn&#x2019;t dare start because he knew Lovell and Anders would insist that he sing it to the end.<br><br>Borman stuck to classic films, too. Alone among astronauts, it seemed, he hadn&#x2019;t bothered to see 2001: A Space Odyssey, the new Stanley Kubrick film released in April that showed men flying to the Moon. That stuff was science fiction, Borman told his colleagues; America had real people to get to the Moon.<br><br>Borman and his crewmates knew that the lunar module was troubled and behind schedule. But until designers and engineers could make the fixes, these astronauts could do little more than make certain that the command module was perfect. So they climbed inside their spacecraft and began testing it, pushing the command module mercilessly, because that&#x2019;s what outer space would do to it, too.<br><br>And then the phone rang.<br><br>Smart people knew better than to bother Borman at work. But the man on the line went back a long way with Borman. And he said it was urgent.<br><br>Donald Kent &#x201c;Deke&#x201d; Slayton was in charge of managing astronaut training and choosing crews for manned space missions. If an astronaut flew on board a NASA spacecraft, it was because Slayton had chosen him to go.<br><br>When Borman heard who was calling, he wriggled out of the capsule and grabbed an extension.<br><br>&#x201c;Deke, I&#x2019;m in the middle of a big test here,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Frank, I need you back in Houston.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Talk to me now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I can&#x2019;t talk over the phone. It&#x2019;s gotta be in person. Grab an airplane and get to Houston. On the double.&#x201d;<br><br>Borman grimaced&#x2014;America did not have time for nonsense and delays&#x2014;but Slayton was in charge, and NASA, no matter its official designation as a civilian organization, was a military operation to Borman, so he took his orders. Poking his head back inside the spacecraft, he told his partners, &#x201c;You guys are stuck with the module. I&#x2019;ve gotta go back to Houston.&#x201d;<br><br>Borman grabbed his rental car, drove to Los Angeles International Airport, and hopped in a T-38 Talon, a two-seat twin-engine supersonic jet used by astronauts for training, commuting, and even some fun, and pointed it toward Texas. At forty, he still looked every bit the West Point cadet: sandy blond near-crewcut, square jaw and chin set for combat, arched eyebrows that seemed a radar for anything askew. Even his head was military issue, all right angles and slightly larger than life, a feature that had earned him the childhood nickname Squarehead.<br><br>Borman couldn&#x2019;t imagine why he was needed in Houston, and so suddenly. He was commander of Apollo 9, the third of four manned test flights NASA planned before it would attempt to land men on the Moon. Apollo 9 was to be a basic mission&#x2014;orbit Earth, test the spacecraft, come home. It wasn&#x2019;t scheduled to launch for another six months. Still, Borman knew he hadn&#x2019;t been summoned for nothing. The last time he&#x2019;d received a &#x201c;drop everything&#x201d; call had been the darkest day in NASA&#x2019;s history.<br><br>It had happened about a year and half earlier, on January 27, 1967, when a fire broke out in the spacecraft during a simulated countdown on the launchpad in Florida. The Apollo 1 rehearsal should have been safe and routine for the three astronauts inside, who were preparing for the actual flight about four weeks later. But a spark occurred in the electrical system and the men were trapped as the sudden fire spread in pure oxygen. Even Ed White, the strongest of all NASA&#x2019;s astronauts, couldn&#x2019;t muscle open the command module&#x2019;s hatch as flames spread through the spacecraft.<br><br>Borman had been enjoying a rare break with his family at a lakeside cottage near Houston, where they lived, when Slayton&#x2019;s call came in that day.<br><br>&#x201c;Frank, we&#x2019;ve had a bad fire on Pad Thirty-four and we&#x2019;ve got three astronauts dead&#x2014;Gus Grissom, Ed White, and one of the new boys, Roger Chaffee. Get to the Cape as quick as you can; you&#x2019;ve been appointed to the investigative committee.&#x201d;<br><br>The news stunned Borman, who considered Ed White the brother he&#x2019;d never had. And it devastated Borman&#x2019;s wife, Susan, who counted Pat White among her best friends. Borman told Slayton he&#x2019;d fly to Florida right away but first needed to stop at the Whites&#x2019; home in Houston.<br><br>When he and Susan arrived, Pat was hysterical. She was the mother of two children, ages ten and thirteen, who suddenly had no father. Even in her raw grief, just hours after receiving the news, a Washington bureaucrat had informed her that despite Ed&#x2019;s wishes to be buried at West Point, the three fallen astronauts would all be laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.<br><br>&#x201c;Give me the guy&#x2019;s name,&#x201d; Borman said.<br><br>He had the man on the phone a minute later.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s already been decided in Washington,&#x201d; the man insisted.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a good goddamn what&#x2019;s been decided,&#x201d; Borman said. &#x201c;Ed wanted to be buried at West Point and that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s going to happen, and I&#x2019;ll go all the way to President Johnson to make sure it happens, so you better fucking well do it.&#x201d;<br><br>Four days later, White was buried at West Point. Borman and Lovell were among the pallbearers. Anders also attended.<br><br>After the funeral, Borman began his work on the investigative committee convened by NASA. He was the only astronaut on the panel, a sign that NASA considered him to be among its best. His first job was to help supervise the disassembly of the Apollo 1 spacecraft at Cape Kennedy in order to determine the cause of the fire. Days later, he became the first astronaut to enter the cabin. He found a burned-out nightmare. Rows of equipment and panels had been charred and covered in soot, debris was scattered everywhere. Hoses connecting the astronauts to their life support systems were melted. No matter where he looked, Borman could see no color, only grays and blacks.<br><br>That night, he joined Slayton and others at a restaurant in Cocoa Beach called The Mousetrap, a NASA haunt. Borman seldom drank to excess, but the smell of the scorched spacecraft needed bleaching, and he started in early. He raised toasts to his fallen brothers, then threw his glass into the fireplace. White was among the straightest arrows Borman had ever known&#x2014;honest to a fault, a true patriot, and a man who didn&#x2019;t mess around with the sports cars or fast women so readily available to astronauts. For both men, family came first. The Bormans and Whites often shared a house on a lake near Houston for fishing trips. Borman couldn&#x2019;t remember missing someone as much as he missed Ed White that night.<br><br>Borman spent the next two months inside the burned spacecraft, studying the design, searching for flaws, making fixes in his mind. In April 1967, Congress held hearings into the cause of the fire, and Borman was called to testify.<br><br>Much of the questioning was aggressive and antagonistic, full of second-guesses and should-haves and pointed fingers, but Borman held firm, hiding nothing and acknowledging NASA&#x2019;s responsibility, but never allowing congressmen to kick the agency just because it was down. He still ached for the loss of his friend, Ed White, but never allowed those emotions to spill into his report. Near the end of the hearings, he offered some of its most memorable testimony.<br><br>&#x201c;We are trying to tell you that we are confident in our management, and in our engineering, and in ourselves,&#x201d; Borman said. &#x201c;I think the question is really: Are you confident in us?&#x201d; A few days later, he told lawmakers, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stop the witch hunt and get on with it.&#x201d; At NASA, it seemed there wasn&#x2019;t a person, from the administrator to the janitors, who didn&#x2019;t cheer him on. In the end, Congress took his advice and NASA continued on its mission to land men on the Moon.<br><br>Having survived the inquest, NASA approached Borman with an extraordinary offer: Take temporary leave from the astronaut program to head up the team tasked with implementing design changes to the command module. He accepted on the spot. He and others worked to make the new version of the capsule the most advanced, and safest, spacecraft ever built.<br><br>Borman could only hope there hadn&#x2019;t been another tragedy as he landed his jet at Ellington Air Force Base and made his way to Slayton&#x2019;s office. He suspected something unusual was afoot when he was asked to close the door behind him. Slayton addressed him without even sitting down:<br><br>&#x201c;We just got word from the CIA that the Russians are planning a lunar fly-by before the end of the year. We want to change Apollo 8 from an Earth orbital to a lunar orbital flight. A lot has to come together. And Apollo 7 has to be perfect. But if it happens, Frank, do you want to go to the Moon?&#x201d;<br><br>The idea startled Borman. Apollo 8 was meant to fly in December, just four months from now, but certainly not to the Moon. Apollo 8 was a conservative mission designed for low Earth orbit, perhaps at 125 miles altitude. It was one of several essential steps leading up to a manned lunar landing, hopefully before the end of 1969. Everything went in steps at NASA. Everything.<br><br>But Slayton meant exactly what he said. He wanted Borman to change missions and fly to the Moon. At a distance of 240,000 miles. In just sixteen weeks. Slayton didn&#x2019;t discuss the fact that the lunar module couldn&#x2019;t possibly be ready by then. He didn&#x2019;t discuss any of the other myriad reasons NASA couldn&#x2019;t be ready to fly men to the Moon by year&#x2019;s end. In fact, Slayton gave very few additional details. He didn&#x2019;t even ask if Borman cared to talk things over with his wife or crew.<br><br>Borman would have been justified in taking days, if not weeks, to consider such a proposition. And yet Slayton needed an answer, and he needed it now. Borman understood the urgency. If the Soviet Union sent men to the Moon first&#x2014;even if those men didn&#x2019;t land&#x2014;it would score a major victory in the Space Race and deal a devastating blow in the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union. The mission Slayton was proposing would be exquisitely dangerous. But it also had the power to change history. Now, suddenly, it all depended on the decision of Frank Borman and his crew.</p><h2>Bishop&#39;s Reach: A Bay Tanner Mystery (Bay Tanner Mysteries)</h2><p>HOW FAR WILL SHE GO...<br>Bleached-blonde call girls rarely bring good news, especially the one who bursts through the door of Bay Tanner&#x2019;s struggling inquiry agency. Karen Zwilling swears she&#x2019;s been viciously attacked but can&#x2019;t, or won&#x2019;t, go to the police. But why? Bay barely has the energy to find out. With the tragedy of her husband&#x2019;s murder finally resolved, Bay&#x2019;s been yearning for a little tranquility...and then, just when she&#x2019;s making strides with Karen&#x2019;s case, a man named Win Hammond enters the picture.<br>&nbsp;<br>BEFORE AN OLD FRIEND BECOMES A DANGEROUS ENEMY?<br>An aging playboy and scion of an old Beaufort family, Hammond has been missing for more than twenty years. His reappearance spells trouble, as does a disfigured corpse that washes up on the beach at Hilton Head. Suddenly nobody is who they appear to be, including Bay&#x2019;s own employees and her former nemesis Ben Wyler...and until the final pieces of this puzzle tumble into place, Bay&#x2019;s investigation may prove to be as treacherous as the waters of...<br><i>Bishop&#x2019;s Reach</i></p><p>Kathryn R. Wall practiced accounting for twenty-five years in Ohio before retiring with her husband to Hilton Head, South Carolina.Chapter One<br>Got him!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Erik Whiteside, his lean, boyish face flushed with triumph, filled the doorway of my tiny office. Behind him, midafternoon light drifted through the narrow windows in the reception area and bathed his white-blond hair in a soft halo.<br>&nbsp;<br>I set aside the financial reports I'd been studying and tossed my reading glasses on the desk. "Got whom?"<br>&nbsp;<br>My partner crossed the gray Berber carpet in two strides and dropped his six-foot-plus frame into the single client chair pulled up to my faux mahogany desk. "You're the only person I know who uses 'whom' in conversation," he said with his trademark grin.<br>&nbsp;<br>"So I'm a grammar geek," I said, smiling back. "Get over it, and answer the question."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Impatient as usual. This one's so good I'm tempted to make you work for it."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Perhaps you might like to recall whose name you see on the bottom of your paycheck, such as it is."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I believe that would be you, Lydia Baynard Simpson Tanner, for which I and my landlord are eternally grateful," he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Though I called him my partner, Erik hadn't managed to accumulate enough cash to buy an actual interest in Simpson &amp; Tanner, Inquiry Agents, but he assured me he was close. My father, retired judge Talbot Simpson, and I had provided the initial investment enabling us to rent the small suite in a recently completed office complex midisland. My late mother's trust fund and the recovering stock market provided operating capital, supplemented occasionally by an actual paying customer. Erik earned his keep by providing a level of computer expertise unequaled outside a government agency.<br>&nbsp;<br>I leaned back in the swivel chair and pinched the bridge of my nose. Time to get my glasses changed, I thought, another depressing reminder of my looming milestone birthday. "Are you going to answer me, or do I have to beat it out of you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>He laughed. " 'They also serve who only stand and wait.' "<br>&nbsp;<br>"Milton," I responded, "from 'On His Blindness.' When are you going to learn you don't have a prayer in this game? I practically had to memorize Bartlett's just to keep up with my father. Now knock it off and spill."<br>&nbsp;<br>His brown eyes sobered. "I found Win Hammond. After nearly two years, I finally tracked him down."<br>&nbsp;<br>"My God," I said, jerking upright in my chair. "How? Where? Is he still alive?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Pure dumb luck is how," he said, leaning forward to rest his elbows on the desk, "and yes, he's still very much alive." Erik consulted his watch. "And if everything works out, he should be landing in Savannah in about four hours."<br>&nbsp;<br>My hand reached of its own volition for a nonexistent pack of cigarettes, although it had been nearly a year since I'd kicked the habit for the second time. I sighed in frustration and picked up a pen to keep my fingers occupied.<br>&nbsp;<br>"So give."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well, you remember the postcard Miss Hammond got from her brother, right about the time . . ." His voice trailed off, and his eyes found mine. The events of that summer two years before--and the rippling aftershocks they'd created--had culminated in a number of deaths, some of which had struck very close to home.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Of course I remember," I said. "He sent her the card after she got attacked. Postmarked from St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands."<br>&nbsp;<br>Adelaide Boyce Hammond, frightened by her brush with death, had asked me to find her black sheep brother. Edwin Hollister Hammond III had abandoned family and country nearly twenty years before and had not been heard from until the mysterious communication which had provided neither return address nor any other useful contact information. Erik and I had been searching for him--off and on--ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why is he coming here? And how . . . ?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"A long time ago I put out a call on several of the message boards originating in the Caribbean, asking if anyone'd heard of him. I got a couple of responses early on, but they turned out to be false alarms."<br>&nbsp;<br>My mind kept wandering to the scene where I actually told Miss Addie her beloved younger brother was coming home, to the joy on her weathered, octogenarian's face when I announced . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>"Earth to Bay, come in please. Are you actually interested in hearing this, or should I just cut to the chase?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sorry," I mumbled. "Of course I want to hear it. Caribbean message boards. False alarms."<br>&nbsp;<br>The phone jangled in the outer office, and Erik half rose. "Let the service get it," I said, and he subsided back into his chair. "Go ahead."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I got back on the trail yesterday when I heard from a woman in the British Virgin Islands, asking if I was still looking for information about Hammond. We exchanged several e-mails before I finally convinced her to do the right thing." He laughed. "I can be very persuasive when I put my mind to it."<br>&nbsp;<br>I returned his smile. In his late twenties, with a long, rangy body and more than his share of blond good looks, Erik Whiteside oozed Southern charm. I couldn't imagine too many people of the female persuasion resisting him, even long distance. Still, it seemed strange the woman hadn't asked for some sort of reward.<br>&nbsp;<br>"So what has Win been up to all these years? Where's he been living?" I tossed the pen back onto the desk and leaned forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>Miss Addie's wish to see her brother once more before she died had seemed an impossible request, my failure to grant it a nagging guilt that had been quietly eating at me for months.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Apparently he's been running a charter service out of Virgin Gorda. Sailing and fishing cruises for wealthy tourists. He's been going by the name of James Holland."<br>&nbsp;<br>"No wonder you couldn't track him down. Why's he coming back to the States?" I glanced at the clock above my framed PI license on the side wall. "And how do you know he's on his way to Savannah?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Again the phone rang on the desk of our phantom receptionist.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sure you don't want me to get it?" Erik asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>"They'll call back if it's important. That's why we pay a fortune for the answering service. Go ahead."<br>&nbsp;<br>The long and short of it was that Erik's informant, a sometime girlfriend of Hammond/Holland, had dropped by to find him stripping his place and throwing clothes into an old suitcase. When she'd asked Win where he was going, he'd become abusive, calling her names and literally throwing her out into the street. She claimed to have known for a long time about his real name and background. Apparently Win was like lots of people who sought refuge in the scattered islands of the Caribbean: He had a past he'd just as soon forget. They'd even laughed together about Erik's Internet inquiries the previous year. And, since there was nothing in it for her, she'd let it ride. But she'd written Erik's contact information on a slip of paper and tucked it into her wallet. Just in case.<br>&nbsp;<br>"And she volunteered all this because . . . ?" I watched the red flush creep up my partner's neck. "You offered her money, didn't you? I thought we agreed--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I wired her five hundred dollars, okay? There was no way she was going to tell me anything without it."<br>&nbsp;<br>He raised his head, and we stared at each other for a long moment.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your own savings, I take it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>He nodded.<br>&nbsp;<br>I sighed and leaned back in my chair. "Okay. I'll reimburse you out of the company account. But just this once. Next time, we need to discuss things before you go running off half-cocked."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Thanks. You're right, but it seemed too good a lead to pass up."<br>&nbsp;<br>And it had been. A quick check of the airline databases, only secure against amateur hackers not even remotely in Erik's league, had revealed Win Hammond's flight and its approximate arrival time.<br>&nbsp;<br>"So did this mystery woman have any idea what's sending the long-lost black sheep of the Hammond family running for home?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Erik shook his head. "She claimed not to know."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't like the sound of this sudden decision to come back to the States after all these years. Five'll get you ten it's got something to do with money. Miss Addie isn't rich, but she's certainly comfortably well-off. This guy sounds like he could be nothing but trouble for her."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Didn't you say they had other sisters? Maybe he plans on hitting them up for room and board or a fresh stake or whatever it is he's got in mind."<br>&nbsp;<br>I shook my head. "Not likely. One of them's in a nursing home, and I remember the other one seemed to have gone through whatever inheritance she'd received. No, I think Miss Addie's the target. His flying into Savannah pretty much clinches it."<br>&nbsp;<br>I ran a hand through the tangled mop of my hair. It had grown out to nearly the length it had been before they'd hacked it all off in the emergency room that awful summer I first got involved in Adelaide Boyce Hammond's problems.<br>&nbsp;<br>"How am I going to tell her the brother she's idolized all these years may be dropping back into her life just for a handout?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You don't," Erik said, and my head snapped up. "Don't get all riled up, Bay. I'm just saying it's really none of our business. We tell her he's coming, give her a little warning so the poor old thing doesn't have a stroke when she opens the front door, and let it go at that. What happens afterward is between the two of them."<br>&nbsp;<br>I knew he was right, but the idea of anyone's taking advantage of Miss Addie set my teeth on edge. She and my late mother had been the cream rising to the top of local society, both of them products of family trees stretching back to the founding of the country. Having withstood the humiliation of the War of Northern Aggression, both families, along with so many others in our little corner of the South Carolina coast, had retained the casual arrogance that went with old money and older lineage. Despite it all, Adelaide Boyce Hammond remained one of the kindest women I'd ever encountered. Her sleazy brother would have me to deal with if he thought he could just show up after all this time and run any sort of scam on the old lady.<br>&nbsp;<br>"So what's the plan?" Erik's voice cut across my reminiscences.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I need to go talk to her in person. I don't think this is something I should do over the telephone."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I agree. What do you want to do about the brother? Want me to meet him at the airport?"<br>&nbsp;<br>I thought about it for a moment. "No, I can't see any point to that. I do think it wouldn't hurt, though, for you to tail him and keep me posted. If he doesn't head straight for Hilton Head, I'll need to know where he's going. Maybe I should hold off alerting Miss Addie until we actually see the whites of his eyes."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Good thought. That way we won't get her hopes up if he doesn't actually intend to contact her."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I can't believe it isn't the whole point of this sudden trip home. That's what your e-mail lady implied, right?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Erik shrugged. "Yeah, but remember she's an ex-girlfriend, so her information may not be entirely reliable. A woman scorned and all that."<br>&nbsp;<br>If he intended to get a rise out of me or engender another quotation contest, I had to disappoint him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why don't you grab some dinner and head on out to the airport? I've got paperwork to finish up on the Matheson file. I'll probably be here another hour or so. After that you can reach me at the Judge's or on my cell. I should be home by eight."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Command performance?"<br>&nbsp;<br>I answered his rhetorical question with a smile. When my father asked me to stop by at Presqu'isle, the old family mansion on St. Helena Island, I generally didn't have the option of saying no. Besides the fact I'd spent most of my life dancing to his tune, his health had deteriorated over the past few months, especially after his harrowing ordeal the previous year. He'd been looking more frail than usual lately, and I'd made it my business to keep a close eye on him. Not that Lavinia Smalls, his companion-housekeeper and the woman who had practically raised me, didn't guard him like a fierce old bird with her hatchlings, but still . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>"Take some money from petty cash for expenses," I said, "and bring me back your receipts."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Aye, aye, Captain," he said, saluting as he rose. At the door, he paused and looked back. "By the way, what's the verdict on Matheson? Is he messing with his partner?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"About money? Probably. I don't have that nailed down yet. Literally? Again, it's hard to say. What do you think? You've been following him off and on for the past week or so. Any indication he swings both ways?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Erik shook his head. "They spend a lot of time together, but it's mostly in public places--restaurants, bars, the golf course. I've never seen any indication they're more than business associates, much as Mrs. M. would like to believe he's in the closet."<br>&nbsp;<br>I shook my head. "I swore when we got into this inquiry agency stuff I wouldn't mess with anything remotely resembling a divorce, and now look at us." I couldn't keep the disgust from my voice. "I thought it was a straight case of cooking the books, something I could verify with half my brain tied behind my back. I did a ton of those when I had the CPA practice in Charleston. Then all of a sudden we're following potentially philandering husbands all over the damn island. I'm almost inclined to give Grace Matheson her retainer back and tell her to find someone else."<br>&nbsp;<br>"That'd be a shame considering all the time we've both put in on it," Erik said in the maddeningly reasonable tone he sometimes adopted when he felt I was about to go off the deep end. "What does Ben have to say about it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>I could feel my ears turning red as Erik studied me from the doorway. Most of the time I tolerated his teasing and ragging, almost as if he were an annoying younger brother. Since I'd grown up without any siblings to practice on, I sometimes didn't know quite how to deal with it. His mention of Ben Wyler, our silent partner and former New York City homicide detective, had been meant to aggravate me, and it worked. We'd needed someone with police experience to allow us to obtain our investigator's license from the state, but that had been the sum total of Wyler's involvement, and I intended to keep it that way. I still hadn't sorted out my feelings about the man who had tried to have me arrested for murder.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Get your butt in gear, Whiteside," I said, "or the plane'll be on the ground before you get off the island. You're going to hit the late-afternoon traffic."<br>&nbsp;<br>With tens of thousands of tourists streaming across the bridges for the start of the summer beach season, our rush hour had become more than its usual nightmare.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You, too," he said, ignoring the jibe and glancing at his watch. "If you're headed for Presqu'isle, you'd better get moving yourself."<br>&nbsp;<br>He had a point. I heard him unlock the drawer in the receptionist's desk and lift o...</p><h2>The Complete Brigadier Gerard (Barnes &amp; Noble Library of Essential Reading)</h2><p>Eighteen short stories about the adventures and exploits of Brigadier Gerard, a bombastic, heroic Gascon hussar, man of many improbable deeds, a creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the man who gave life to Sherlock Holmes, to the delight of the world.</p><p></p><h2>Age of Apocalypse: Warzones!</h2><p>Survival of the fittest.

Almost 20 years later, she set out to achieve her ambition. Her epic journey began during the coldest winter in memory, taking her through Europe, Persia, Afghanistan, over the Himalayas to Pakistan, and into India. This captivating account Murphy&#x2019;s first is an enchantment that holds the reader to the final page.</p><p>Dervla Murphy is one of the very best loved of travel writers. She was born in County Waterford and since 1964 has been regularly publishing accounts of her journeys - by bicycle and on foot -- in the remoter areas of four continents. She has also written about the problems of Northern Ireland, the hazards of nuclear power, and race relations in Britain. The Times Literary Supplement called her &#39;an admirable woman -- she has a romantic soul and a keen eye&#39;.This book recounts a trip, taken mostly on bicycle, by a gritty Irishwoman in 1963. Her route was through Yugoslavia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and ended in New Delhi. She carried a pistol, got sunstroke, and suffered the usual stomach disorders. She endured bad accommodations but reaped much local hospitality, too, including a dinner with the Pakistani president. Most of the book concerns the high mountain country of Afghanistan and Pakistan. First published in England in 1965, the book is neither current, nor quite old enough to be of much historical interest. Nonetheless, it is a spirited account, suitable for larger public library collections. Unfortunately, it lacks illustrations, and the two maps included give us little idea of the remote areas she visited. Harold M. Otness, Southern Oregon State Coll.

Border designs, pastel pages, and striking layouts that include art objects, full-color photographs, and contemporary engravings give these series entries immense visual vitality. Each book opens with an introduction, followed by a historical account of each kingdom. Epilogues bring the areas into the 20th century. Mann's writing is interesting and generally clear, though aspects of organization are confusing, e.g., chapters on single kingdoms are not gathered into units. A few puzzling inaccuracies crop up, such as naming Milton Obote as Zimbabwe's first prime minister (Monomotapa). Multicolored maps, while easy to read, do not include some features considered important enough to be mentioned in the text, and many terms in the fascinating sidebars are not found in the indexes. Partly because they draw on a wealth of good secondary sources, the chapters on Kongo may provide the best treatment of an African kingdom for young people, for they are unique in their detail and in the way that they deal with the variety of sources used by historians in finding out about Africa's past. Archaeological and linguistic evidence are discussed in the introduction. Monomotapa is weaker, in part because it covers so much ground but also because, for Zulu, Shaka, and the Mfecane, Mann relies uncritically on common South African sources that reflect history written in a white-dominated society.?Loretta Kreider Andrews, Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimore, MD<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Little Bear Lost</h2><p>Old Bear and the other toys play hide-and-seek but no one can find Little Bear.</p><p>Since studying illustration and design at Brighton, Jane has written and illustrated over 20 picture books.

Unfortunately, the abrupt transition from the realistic, leisurely opening of the story to its fantasy conclusion seems to crack the story in half like an egg. Jewel swears that "the one thing... she would never do, no matter what, was ride a horse." But the girl feels protective of Bug, a newborn runtlike foal, and Hoffman convincingly conveys the blossoming relationship between girl and horse. At a climactic moment, Jewel mounts Bug in response to a cruel classmate's challenge to a horse race; she can't stop Bug from running over a cliff and jumps off him. Here the tale takes a preposterous turn. In an unlikely scenario, while Jewel walks to the cliff's edge to check on the horse, "everyone else headed back to the school." Thus, only Jewel witnesses Bug unfurling previously undetectable wings. Later, during one of Bug's flights, a circus owner sees his gifts and abducts him. Timid Jewel single-handedly saves not only Bug, but also a herd of ponies trained by a woman who beats them. Hoffman unfolds her story with graceful language and a compelling voice, but the tale's swoop into fantasy may leave readers befuddled. Johnson and Fancher's dark and hazy paintings are appropriately mysterious, but do little to help make the fantasy elements of the story believable. Ages 5-9. (Aug.) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 3-This fantasy requires a very strong suspension of disbelief. Jewel is given a rejected foal to raise and discovers that it has wings and can fly. Unfortunately, an unscrupulous circus owner sees the horse and steals him. Jewel tracks them down that very same day, finds a costume in order to disguise herself as a circus performer, and by evening not only rescues Bug but also frees the other mistreated horses. The animals return with her to her grandfather's farm, and she and Bug fly happily ever after. Anyone who knows horses and riding may find it hard to enter into this fantasy since it violates so much of what they know. However, it is a story for dreamers and many children will love it for the good-versus-evil conflicts, the exciting events, and Johnson and Fancher's muted paintings that ably illustrate the story. Those who dream of riding on Bug's back and soaring through the clouds probably won't even realize that the plot of a lost animal found and rescued from the circus is hackneyed and trite.<br><i>Louise L.

The book examines the many ways that theology became modern while seeing how modernity arose in no small part from theology. These intertwined stories progress through four parts.<br>In Part I, Emerging Modernity, Simpson discusses the period from the beginnings of modernity in the late Middle Ages through the Protestant Reformation and Renaissance Humanism to the creative tension between Enlightenments and Awakenings of the 18th-century. Part II, The Long Nineteenth-Century, presents the great movements and figures arising out of these creative tension - from Romanticism and Schleiermacher to Ritschlianism and Vatican I. Part III, Twentieth-Century Crisis and Modernity, proceeds through the revolutionary theologies of the period of the World Wars such as that of Karl Barth or <i>nouvelle th�ologie</i>. Finally, Part IV, The Late Modern Supernova, lays out the diverse panoply of recent theologies - from the various liberation theologies to the revisionist, the secular, the postliberal, and the postsecular.</p><p>Designed for classroom use, this volume includes the following features:<br> - charts/diagrams/visual organizations of the information presented included throughout <br> - both a one-page chapter title table of the contents and an expanded (multipage) table of contents<br> - chapter at-a-glance outlines at the beginning of each chapter<br> - references to further reading at the end of chapters</p></p><p>How has theology influenced modernity?

Zweig studies three giants of German literature and thought: Friedrich Holderlin, Heinrich von Kleist and Friedrich Nietzsche &#x2013; powerful minds whose ideas were at odds with the scientific positivism of their age; troubled spirits whose intoxicating passions drove them mad but inspired them to great works. In their struggle with their inner creative force, Zweig reflects the conflict at the heart of the European soul &#x2013; between science and art, reason and inspiration.<br><br>Both highly personal and philosophically wide-ranging, this is one of the most fascinating of Zweig&#x2019;s renowned biographical studies.</p><p>Stefan Zweig (1881-1942) was born in Vienna, a member of a wealthy Austrian-Jewish family. He studied in Berlin and Vienna and was first known as a poet and translator, then as a biographer. Zweig travelled widely, living in Salzburg between the wars, and enjoyed literary fame. His stories and novellas were collected in 1934. In the same year, with the rise of Nazism, he briefly moved to London, taking British citizenship. After a short period in New York, he settled in Brazil where in 1942 he and his wife were found dead in bed in an apparent double suicide.<p>&#x201c;What did Zweig have that brought him the fanatical devotion of millions of readers, the admiration of Herman Hesse, the invitation to give the eulogy at the funeral of Sigmund Freud? To learn that, we would have to have a biography that illuminated&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;aspects of his work, that read&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;of his books, and that challenged, rather than accepted, the apparent modesty of his statements about his life and work.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2013; Benjamin Moser,&nbsp;<i>Bookforum</i></b><br><br>"Zweig&#x2019;s readability made him one of the most popular writers of the early twentieth century all over the world, with translations into thirty languages. His lives of Mary Stuart and Marie Antoinette were international bestsellers."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;&nbsp;</i>Julie Kavanagh,&nbsp;</b><i><i><i><b>The&nbsp;<i>Economist</i></b><i><b>&nbsp;</b><i><b>Intelligent Life</b><i><br><br></i></i></i></i></i></i>"Zweig&#x2019;s accumulated historical and cultural studies, whether in essay or monograph form, remain a body of achievement almost too impressive to take in...

Those adjectives are not meant as faint praise. Zweig may be especially appealing now because rather than being a progenitor of big ideas, he was a serious entertainer, and an ardent and careful observer of habits, foibles, passions and mistakes."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;&nbsp;</i>A.O.

Jillian lives in Southern California with her husband and three daughters.England 1814<br><br>The late Dominic Breckland, Viscount Stratfield, was returning to life in a sea of women&#x2019;s underwear. From ear to ankle he fought a sensual undertow of lacy shifts and white silk stockings, his muscular arms tangled in the ties and tapes of lavender-scented buckram stays, his heavy thighs wrapped in a pair of dainty French percale pantalettes. Like a wounded beast of the night, he had eluded capture and taken refuge in the last place his pursuer would think to look.<br><br>Summoning a primitive instinct for survival, he had climbed the sturdy oak tree outside the manor house and hauled his bruised and bleeding six-foot frame over the windowsill. Hopeful he had outwitted the man who chased him, he had then collapsed&#x2014;into an open trunk stuffed with personal female attire and frivolous accessories.<br><br>He was not too exhausted to appreciate the irony of the situation.<br><br>For now at least he had managed to escape the man who was hunting for him. Yet moment by moment his life&#x2019;s blood was saturating an unknown woman&#x2019;s muslin petticoats and blush-pink stockings. Pain seared his upper body. Gritting his teeth, he unraveled from his elbow a flimsy lawn chemise embroidered with blue silk forget-me-nots. His gaze unfocused and brimming with deviltry, he examined it in the moonlight.<br><br>If he was going to die, for the second time in a month, he might as well go out on a rousing sexual fantasy. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he murmured, &#x201c;what sort of woman are you anyway? Fast or merely fashionable? Do I have a choice? Then give me fast.&#x201d;<br><br>Unfortunately the maidenly garment failed to inspire a potent sexual image in his mind.

It seemed to him that he had once owned this creaky old manor house, at some time in the murky past, and he tried to remember who had bought it from him. To his frustration his brain refused to focus, images flitting elusively behind his eyes like moths in the shadows.<br><br>A retired sea captain, wasn&#x2019;t it?

His lanky frame had lost flesh. The hollows below his cheekbones gave his masculine face a dangerous gauntness. The lugubrious pattern of surgeon&#x2019;s stitches that crisscrossed his chest and left shoulder had been torn during his tree-climbing escapade. Taking a breath that burrowed into his lungs like talons, he felt with his uninjured arm for the windowsill and hoisted himself upright for a few moments of enlightening agony.<br><br>His gray eyes widened in approval as he took stock of his surroundings.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, isn&#x2019;t this convenient?&#x201d; he said, clenching his teeth against a wave of pain. &#x201c;A room with a view.&#x201d;<br><br>His own estate lay across the swathe of moonlit road on a wooded rise. Warm beams of candlelight glowed from the bedroom window where he had been brutally stabbed &#x201c;to death&#x201d; three weeks ago. His uncle, Colonel Sir Edgar Williams, had already taken possession of the house, and if Dominic had access to a spyglass, he could have identified the shadowy figure standing behind the curtains.<br><br>The taunting silhouette belonged to a woman, he thought in cynical detachment. Of that he had no doubt. But whether she was the same lady who had shared his bed while he was callously being stabbed, he could not say. Nor did it matter now. That love affair belonged to a past life and had died along with his previous identity. His feelings for his former mistress were as dead as she believed him to be.<br><br>The clip-clop of approaching horses, the churning of carriage wheels on the road, interrupted his troubled reflections. Pray God whoever owned this trunk would not decide to explore her dressing closet tonight. For if he was any judge of women&#x2019;s underwear, and it so happened that he was, then the delicately proportioned owner of these garments would quite indelicately scream her head off when she discovered a ghost in her intimate garments. * * *<br><br>From the stuffy depths of the lumbering carriage, Lady Chloe Boscastle could discern one of her undergarments dangling like a banner of indecency from her bedroom window. She leaned forward, her body frozen in disbelief, her face turning pale. The bulk of her personal belongings had arrived from London just that morning. She and the maid had barely started to unpack them, let alone put them on display from her window.<br><br>She attempted to close the carriage curtains in a casual manner, hoping the other passengers would not notice this disconcerting sight. Not that anyone would be surprised by such a faux pas from Chloe at this point. She had brought the inglorious label of troublemaker with her from London and was almost expected to continue her worrying ways. Far be it from her to disappoint her growing critics.<br><br>The errant undergarment&#x2014;heavens above, it rather looked like her favorite chemise&#x2014;could only mean that her scapegrace brother Devon had come and gone while she had been carted off to a country ball in a cavernous cobwebby hall.<br><br>And what had the rascal pilfered from her room this time? she wondered in alarm. He had already pawned off a good deal of her jewelry to pay off his debts. But surely he had not stooped to stealing her underthings. . . .<br><br>A more amusing thought jolted her upright. Could Devon be walking about the countryside disguised as a woman? Or had he found a female companion to give him shelter? He was supposed to be lying low with an elderly relative in the next village. Chloe realized her brother, a nobleman who had overnight become a sort of heroic outlaw due to a stupid prank, felt a little desperate. Being a Boscastle, she was a very liberal person herself, but even so, there were limits to decent behavior. Devon seemed to be dangerously testing those limits beyond what a wicked Boscastle would usually dare.<br><br>She turned away from the window as the ancient carriage labored between the rusty iron gates of the modest estate, making enough noise to raise the dead. A furtive glance at the endearingly blank faces of her aunt and uncle, also ancient in her eyes, reassured her they had not noticed the wayward article in the window of their wayward niece&#x2019;s bedroom.<br><br>&#x201c;As I was saying,&#x201d; Uncle Humphrey continued to his wife, &#x201c;the cat was only being a cat, Gwennie. He did not drag the dead mouse to the parson&#x2019;s chair deliberately to embarrass you. It was an offering of the hunt.&#x201d;<br><br>Aunt Gwendolyn gave a delicate shudder, her bosom lifting and falling like a wave. &#x201c;I was mortified beyond words. It happened right when the poor parson was recounting the latest antics of the Stratfield Ghost.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not that deuced ghost again, Gwennie. Not in front of Chloe.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Allegory of Love</h2><p>Love is the commonest these of serious imaginative literature and is still generally regarded as anble and ennbling passion. Love has not always taken such precedence, however, and it was in fact not until the eleventh century that French poets first began to express the romantic species of passion which English peots were still writing about in the nineteenth century. This book is intended for students of medieval literature from A-level upwards. Anyone interested in the `Courtly Love&#39; tradition. Fans of C.S. Lewis&#39;s writings.</p><p>A classic study of the allegorical power of love in literature, traced through major works of the medieval and Renaissance periods, by one of the major literary critics of the twentieth century.Clive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast, Ireland, in 1898. He was a professor of medieval and Renaissance literature at Oxford and Cambridge universities who wrote more than thirty books in his lifetime, including &#34;The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, &#34; and &#34;Mere Christianity&#34;. Lewis is arguably the most influential Christian writer of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Nightmare of Reason: Life of Franz Kafka</h2><p>Kafka is a modern myth. Not only his work, but the distortions in previous biographies make this so. The book is informed by psychological insights but does no depend on them.</p><p><b>Ernst Pawel </b>was born in Berlin and lived in Yugoslavia before coming to the United States. He was the author of three novels and the award-winning <i>The Nightmare of Reason: A Life of Franz Kafka</i>.The Nightmare of Reason<br><i>One</i>IN Prague, he is always present but never mentioned, and it comes as a shock suddenly to find oneself face to face with him in the heart of the city--Kafka's brooding features, life-size, cast in black bronze and mounted above eye level on the wall of a drab building on Maisel Street. On this spot, so a small plaque proclaims, stood the house in which the writer Franz Kafka was born.It is a modest memorial, conceived in ambivalence and therefore singularly fitting in its way. Commissioned by Communist authorities, designed by the sculptor Karel Hadlik, and unveiled in 1965, at a time when the human face of socialism began to rise above the parapets of Stalinoid concrete, it was intended as the initial stage in Kafka's metamorphosis from decadent nihilist into a revolutionary critic of capitalist alienation. In the summer of 1968, Soviet tanks put an end to liberal illusions, and further efforts at rehabilitating Kafka were suspended. But his presence, once acknowledged, is hard to exorcise in a town where every moment of the day and night recalls his nightmares. The bronze sculpture was left in place, so was the marker on his house in the Alchemists' Lane--concessions to tourism, or one of those Schweikian triumphs of cunning that have kept the Czech cause alive through the ages. Either way, they bear witness to one all-important, fundamental fact of Kafka's existence: that he was born in Prague, was buried in Prague, and spent almost all forty-one years of his life in this citadel of lost causes, the "little mother with claws" that never loosened her grip on him and shaped his vision of the world.An uncanny world in which to grow up, still solidly embedded in the Middle Ages, walled in by mystery and legend turned to stone. The view from the Kafka windows stretched back over the centuries, and every walk, every errand took the child through the vaulted archways and twisting alleys of a vengeful past. This was to be his life's stage.Friedrich Thieberger, a renowned Jewish scholar with whom Kafka later studied Hebrew, recounts that "once, as Franz and I were standing at the window looking down on Old Town Square, he pointed at the buildings and said: 'This was my high school, the university was over there, in the building facing us, my office a bit further to the left. This narrow circle ...' and his finger described a few small circles, 'this narrow circle encompasses my entire life.'"But long before the town became a concept in the child's mind, long before the physical reality of even his most immediate environment began to register in meaningful and coherent images, he had to find his way in the far more bewildering shadow world of very large, powerful human beings and learn to deal with the dual threat of both their presence and their absence. What Kafka chose to remember about his childhood is highly revealing, though no more so than what he chose to forget. Even a "memory come alive," as he once described himself in one of his last diary entries, tends to be selective in ways determined by beginnings beyond memory--by a real-life mother who unwittingly betrayed him long before her image fused with the symbol of his quest for love, just as the real-life father, with his waxed mustache and drill-sergeant temper, preceded the image of divine omnipotence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Posterity has come to know them only as "Kafka's parents"--such are the perils of raising a writer in the family, especially a writer devoid of conscious hypocrisy. Yet Herrmann Kafka was already thirty-one years old when he became Kafka's father, a demanding role at best, for which he happened to be particularly ill equipped. The very qualities that had enabled him to claw his way out of grinding poverty into middle-class respectability and relative affluence--unself-conscious egotism, brute drive, and a single-minded concentration on money and status--did not make for grace, warmth, and sensitivity in his contacts with people in general. As a parent, however, he suffered from an additional handicap: he himself had never had a childhood.His own father, Jakob Kafka, born in 1814, was the second of nine children--six boys and three girls--raised in a one-room shack in the Czech village of Wossek. Under the laws then in force, he was not permitted to marry; a 1789 decree promulgated to curb the growth of the Jewish population barred any but the oldest son of Jewish parents fromobtaining a marriage license, and Jakob had a stepbrother older by a year. What saved him from dying without legitimate progeny--death twice over, in the context of his faith--was the revolution of 1848, or rather its savage repression. By the sort of ironic paradox that crops up with predictable unpredictability throughout Jewish history, the new constitution, designed to strengthen the hand of the autocratic government, brought Jews the very freedoms which the French Revolution and its aftershocks had promised but largely failed to deliver.In granting full citizenship rights to the roughly 400,000 Jews within the empire--including the right to marry at will, to settle in the cities, and to enter trades and professions--the Habsburg bureaucracy was moved not by humanitarian impulses but by political and economic considerations. The business skills and energy of peddlers, moneylenders, and craftsmen were an untapped resource invaluable to a country on the verge of industrialization, and the Jews' peculiar, cohesive, but supranational allegiance made them a potential counterforce to the radicalism of contending nationalities that threatened the survival of the multinational state. But all that mattered to Kafka's grandfather Jakob, in 1848, was that at last he could marry, and he proceeded to do so at once, taking as his wife the daughter of his next-door neighbor.A kosher butcher by trade, Jakob Kafka was a surly giant of a man, reputedly able to lift a bag of potatoes with his teeth, but all his backbreaking labor never netted him more than the barest subsistence. His wife, Franziska Platowski, already thirty-three when she married, had an outgoing and cheerful disposition that, under the circumstances, should have qualified her for sainthood. Between 1850 and 1859, she gave birth to six children and raised them all in that one-room shack, in abject poverty; for long stretches, the family's diet consisted of little more than potatoes.Somehow they survived--the parents as well as all six of their children--itself a rare feat in its day, and evidence of robust genetic equipment. (The shack itself, though, still inhabited after the Second World War, outlasted them all.) The children were put to work as soon as they were strong enough to pull a cart. Summer and winter, in any kind of weather, they had to make the rounds delivering slabs of meat to Jakob's far-flung clientele. The frostbites and footsores that Herrmann, the second-oldest, suffered as a result became his battle scars; he kept regurgitating the inventory of his childhood privations with a mixture of pride and self-pity which his own son in turn found singularlyrevolting. In fact, the perennial paternal litany, half boast and half accusation, of "You don't know how well off you are ... When I was your age ..." loomed large on the list of grievances Kafka hoarded against his father.This sniping across the generation gap is common enough. But in contrast to so many fathers licking their imaginary wounds, Herrmann did not have to invent or exaggerate the hardships of his youth in order to score points, and no one saw this more clearly than the target of his scorn. In "Josephine, the Singer," Kafka's last story, written on his deathbed, he evokes the world in which his father came of age:Our life [he wrote, referring to Josephine's "nation of mice"] simply happens to be such that a child, as soon as it can get about a little and is to some extent able to find its way in the world, must take care of itself just like an adult. We are, for economic reasons, scattered over too large an area, our enemies are too numerous, the dangers that everywhere lie in wait for us are too unpredictable--we simply cannot afford to shield our children from the struggle for existence; to do so would doom them to an early grave. But one additional reason should be cited, this one hopeful rather than depressing: the fertility of our tribe. One generation--and each is immensely populous--crowds the other; the children have no time to be children ... no sooner has a child made its appearance than it is a child no more; other children's faces press in from behind ... rosy with happiness. Yet however charming this may be, and however much others may rightly envy us for it, the fact remains that we cannot give our children a true childhood.The ancestors of both Jakob and Franziska had for at least a century lived in Jewish enclaves surrounded by a Czech peasant population. Unlike most of their coreligionists, forced by a 1787 decree to adopt German surnames, they had--presumably by special dispensation--chosen Slavic names; the Kafkas, at any rate, always assumed that their family name derived from <i>kavka,</i> the Czech word for "jackdaw," although <i>Jakovke</i>, a Yiddish diminutive for Jakob, is another and not unlikely derivation.The Kafkas spoke Czech at home but, like all Jews, sent their children to the Jewish school--schools were denominational, a six-year attendance compulsory for boys--where, by law, German was the language of instruction. Herrmann did his compulsory stint, the full extentof his formal education, and became fluent in spoken German, though he never quite mastered the intricacies of the written language and, to the end of his life, evidently felt more at home in Czech.At fourteen, one year into manhood under Jewish law, he left home for good to make his way in the world. Despite stiff competition, the young peddler survived on his own. Retail distribution in rural areas was still in its infancy, while the increasing volume and variety of manufactured goods--especially in Bohemia, cradle of the nascent industry --required domestic outlets. The Jewish peddlers thus filled a growing need, and many of them laid the foundations for what in later years became respectable fortunes. Some switched to manufacturing; Franz Werfel's father came to own the largest glove factory in Bohemia, Freud's father had a textile plant in Moravia. Others progressed from moneylending to high finance or, like Herrmann Kafka, expanded into the retail and wholesale business.Altogether, the economic position of Austro-Hungarian Jewry in the second half of the nineteenth century improved rapidly. The manifest success of the "founding fathers," however, ought not to obscure the merciless struggle it took to rise from well below bare subsistence to even the relatively modest heights eventually scaled by a Herrmann Kafka. The attitudes and opinions shaped by this experience came to dominate Jewish middle-class life to the end. But even more significant was the preponderance of certain personality traits favoring survival in the ruthlessly competitive world of emerging capitalism, a natural selection that made for a remarkable degree of uniformity in the pattern of their family relations.No one defined and explored that pattern more creatively than Sigmund Freud, himself a child of that same time and place--born at Pribor, Moravia, the son of a textile merchant who went bankrupt as a result of the Czech anti-German and anti-Jewish boycott and moved his family to Vienna in 1859, when Freud was three years old. The world that shaped Freud's vision, the rising Jewish middle class in nineteenth-century Austria, was also the world of the Kafkas, and the almost paradigmatic nature of the oedipal conflict in that family, the often startling literalness with which Kafka himself seemed to be acting out the Freudian script, no doubt owes much to these common antecedents.Psychoanalysis, not least for that very reason, has contributed highly pertinent insights to an understanding of Kafka's character and work.But our ultimate concern is not so much with the ways in which he typified all sons locked in mortal combat with their fathers as with the ways in which he was different and unique: how he came to be Franz Kafka.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For six years, young Herrmann traveled the byways of rural Bohemia and Moravia. In 1872, at the age of twenty, he was drafted into the Austrian army, served the prescribed two years, during which he was promoted to sergeant, and after his discharge headed for Prague to seek his fortune.The removal of residence restrictions in 1848 had triggered a mass migration of Jews from country to city. To a landless population, subsisting on the margins of an impoverished agricultural economy, the city was the new Jerusalem, the promise of the good life. To the Jews, moreover, increasingly victimized by anti-Semitism, the city also offered such safety as lies in numbers and in anonymity. Within mere decades, the rural ghettoes were deserted, and villages such as Wossek had to close their synagogues for lack of a minyan.Herrmann settled in the decaying slums of the Josephstadt, Prague's teeming medieval ghetto, with its string of bordellos and sleazy dives. It was not the most propitious of times for a young man without funds or connections. The Vienna stock-market crash of 1873 closed out two decades of unprecedented boom and signaled the onset of what turned out to be a tenacious and long-lasting depression. But the twenty-two-year-old army veteran, accustomed to hardship and frugal in his habits, was determined to find ways of starting a business of his own. It took him eight years. He got his chance in 1883, when he married the daughter of a wealthy brewery owner.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>His bride, Julie L�wy, was born on March 23, 1856, in Podebrady, a predominantly Czech town on the river Elbe. Her ancestry included an unusual array of remarkable or at least unconventional characters, deeply religious for the most part and far more concerned with metaphysical pursuits and spiritual values than with the accumulation of worldly goods--Talmudists, miracle rabbis, eccentric troublemakers,Christian converts, and visionaries. In a brief autobiographical sketch written in 1911, Kakfa alluded to this exotic heritage:My Hebrew name is Amschel, after my mother's maternal grandfather, whom my mother--she was six at the time of his death--remembers as a very pious and learned man with a long white beard. She remembers how she had to hold on to the toes of the corpse while asking his forgiveness for whatever wrongs she may have done him. She remembers her grandfather's many books lining the walls. He bathed in the river every day, even in winter, when he had to chop a hole in the ice. My mother's mother died before her time of typhoid fever. Her death so affected the grandmother that she became melancholy, refused to eat, spoke to no one, and, one year after her daughter's death, went out for a walk and never returned; they pulled her corpse out of the Elbe River. Even more learned than my mother's grandfather was her great-grandfather, equally renowned among both Christians and Jews. Once, during a conflagration, his piety worked a miracle; the flames spared his house while devouring all the others around it. He had four sons; one converted to Christianity and became a physician. All of them died young, except for my mother's grandfather. He had one son, whom my mother knew as Crazy Uncle Nathan, and one daughter, my mother's mother.

It&#39;s a &#34;paper lantern&#34; to illuminate your path. Your dreams glow in the dark even if you don&#39;t ever tend to them. They will wait for you. I know this from my experiences as a recovering procrastinator and perfectionist. My dreams waited for me -- now you can begin to make your creative dreams REAL!</p><p>SARK (Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy) is an author/artist and acclaimed teacher on the subject of creativity. She was featured on the PBS series Women of Wisdom and Power. She is a recovering procrastinator and perfectionist who practices what she teaches and lives in a Magic Cottage in San Francisco with her &#34;fur husband&#34; cat, Jupiter. You can visit her website at PlanetSark.com.For those of us who pass our days in a meaningless miasma of obligations and responsibility, SARK's upbeat 12-step prescription for "making creative dreams" come true may be just the ticket. Designing the book herself, SARK (short for Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy, author of <i>Succulent Wild Woman</i>) applies function to form with big and small font sizes, wild and wavy typesetting, drawings scattered liberally throughout, various exercises, Mad Lib-like blanks to fill in ("choose a micromovement and write it here_____") and three 16-page full-color inserts (not seen by PW). In case you doubt SARK's enthusiasm for her version of the creative life, she includes testimonials ranging from "John, Teacher" to "Val, Expressive Arts Therapist." Despite SARK's admirably unrestrained support for the creative life, it's difficult not to cock a cynical eye at some of her suggestions, such as "let your dream vehicle out to play!" And while she encourages us to "feel free to color or draw in this book," there isn't actually all that much room to do so. SARK addresses the negativity toward creativity that so many artists face from family, schools and bosses, but the repetition of the word "dream" never quite seems to slide over into how to use it to tend an actual artistic career. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each of these titles introduces the history and culture of an empire that was influential in the development of Mesopotamia. They all begin with the same chapter describing the prehistoric tribal origins that led to the rise of more powerful, organized city-states and cultures during the early history of the Middle East. Subsequent chapters focus on the rise and ultimate demise of the specific empire. The texts are lucid, smoothly written, and easy to understand. Large type; open pages; and frequent use of maps, full-color and black-and-white photographs and illustrations of artifacts and architecture enhance the readability and usefulness of these titles. Topics covered include daily life and customs of different classes; social roles; notable rulers and their accomplishments; advances made in law, the arts, agriculture, and sciences; and factors leading to the decline of that empire. A good complement to these books is Clarice Swisher's The Ancient Near East (Lucent, 1995), which does a commendable job of tying these Mesopotamian cultures together, giving readers better insight into the development of early Middle Eastern civilization up to the conquest by Alexander the Great.?Cynthia M.

Whenever anyone mentions &#39;Reiver&#39;, no-one hesitates to add &#39;Border&#39;. It is an inextricable association, and rightly so. Nowhere else in Britain in the modern era, or indeed in Europe, did civil order break down over such a wide area, or for such a long time. For more than a century the hoof-beats of countless raiding parties drummed over the border. From Dumfriesshire to the high wastes of East Cumbria, from Roxburghshire to Redesdale, from the lonely valley of Liddesdale to the fortress city of Carlisle, swords and spears spoke while the law remained silent. Fierce family loyalty counted for everything while the rules of nationality counted for nothing. The whole range of the Cheviot Hills, its watershed ridges and the river valleys which flowed out of them became the landscape of larceny while Maxwells, Grahams, Fenwicks, Carletons, Armstrongs and Elliots rode hard and often for plunder. These were the Riding Times and in modern European history, they have no parallel. This book tells the remarkable story of the Reivers and how they made the Borders.</p><p><b>Alistair Moffat</b> was born and raised in Kelso.

Your family is beset with problems. That is to say, it is a normal family. Since you are a believer in God you have most certainly prayed to God about many of these problems. And maybe you have had the joy of answered prayer for some, some respite for others, but there are still those problems that don't seem to go anywhere! Your image of God is seriously shaken because you don't understand why He doesn't seem to hear you on these particular issues. Your voice feels like a cry in the desert. This serious issue is addressed in a truly fresh and inspired book, "The Healing of Families", by renowned author Father Yozefu-B. Ssemakula, who hails from Uganda, and is now ministering in the U.S. based in the Pensacola-Tallahassee diocese. His in-depth book is filled with powerful prayers to cleanse and heal the family. Fr. Ssemakula presents a simple, effective, and powerful prayer method for freeing you and your family from problems you have prayed about for a long time without results, including health issues. Through Father's inspired book and seminar you will learn to distinguish between the true Cross of Christ that we have to carry for our salvation, Mt 16:24 (necessary suffering), and the false Cross, which is a simple captivity and oppression of God's children, LK 4:18 (unnecessary suffering). God never wills evil and pain for us at any point in our lives. Evil and pain are interruptions of God's plan for our lives Jer 29:11, even if good can be extracted from them. 1 John 4:8 tells us: "God is love." John 10:10 states: "I came that they might have life and have in abundantly." God's will is always good. When things turn out bad for us, it can never be the will of God. In Baptism, God pre-equipped us with all the tools we need to effectively deal with the majority of our problems. In reading Father's book or attending a Healing of Families seminar you will understand how to use the tools of your Baptism to end recurrent problems in your lives.</p><p></p><h2>The crows of pearblossom,</h2><p><p>Written in 1944 by Aldous Huxley as a Christmas gift for his niece, <i>The Crows of Pearblossom</i> tells the story of Mr. and Mrs. Crow, who live in a cottonwood tree.

By delving into the patriarchs' lives, Boice demonstrates how much they are like us and how easily we relate to them, both in triumphs and failures.<br><br>The second of three volumes on the Book of Genesis, A New Beginning shows how God changed the course of history beginning with one less-than-perfect man. It reveals the patriarchs' stories as compelling, dramatic, and true to life.

He was the first writer to successfully merge realism with genre fiction, and by so doing I think he may actually have created the kind of popular fiction that drove the best-seller lists and lit up the American imagination in the years 1960 to 2000. Books as disparate as <em>The New Centurions</em>, <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em>, <em>The Godfather</em>, <em>Black Sunday</em>, and <em>The Shining</em> all owe a debt to Evan Hunter, who taught a whole generation of baby boomers how to write stories that were not only entertaining but that truthfully reflected the times and the culture. He will be remembered for bringing the so-called "police procedural" into the modern age, but he did so much more than that. And he was one hell of a nice man. --<em>Stephen King<br><br></em>Way back in the mid-1970s, when I was a new writer and police series were very big, my editor asked me to do a series called <em>Joe Ryker, NYPD.</em> I had no idea how to write a police detective novel, but the editor handed me a stack of books and said, &#x201c;These are the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain. Read them and you&#x2019;ll know everything you need to know about police novels.&#x201d; After I read the first book--which I think was <em>Let&#x2019;s Hear It for the Deaf Man</em>--I was hooked, and I read every Ed McBain I could get my hands on. Then I sat down and wrote my own detective novel, <em>The Sniper</em>, featuring Joe Ryker. My series never reached the heights of the 87th Precinct series, but by reading those classic masterpieces, I learned all I needed to know about urban crime and how detectives think and act. And I had a hell of a time learning from the master. Years later, when I actually got to meet Ed McBain/Evan Hunter, I told him this story, and he said, &#x201c;I would have liked it better if my books inspired you to become a detective instead of becoming my competition.&#x201d; Evan and I became friends, and I was privileged to know him and honored to be in his company. I remain indebted to him for his good advice over the years. But most of all, I thank him for hundreds of hours of great reading. --<em>Nelson DeMille</em> <p>To read about how Ed McBain influenced other mystery and thriller writers, visit our Perspectives on McBain page.</p> <p>For a complete selection of 87th Precinct novels available from Thomas &amp; Mercer, visit our Ed McBain's 87th Precinct Booklist.</p>Ed McBain has been the recipient of the Grand Master Award of the Mystery Writers of America.

Some of the dialogue is more vivid than the 1998 film--when a kid sees the deadly iceberg, he says excitedly, "Oh, Muddie, look at the beautiful North Pole with no Santa Claus on it."<p> But much has been discovered since Lord's original book made waves--such as the shipwreck itself, and a wealth of scientific inquiry. So he wrote this semisequel, which tackles each of the remaining mysteries about the unnecessary calamity in a methodical, but quite readable, fashion. How come the wireless operators blew it so fatally? Maybe they would have had better operators if they paid them more than $5 a week--as Lord notes, it would have taken a wireless operator 18 years to earn one transatlantic ticket. How come the <i>Californian</i> just sat there in nearby waters and neglected to save anyone on the frantically signaling and flare-firing <i>Titanic</i>? Lord quotes a man on the nonsinking ship admitting to "a certain amount of slackness," which he uses for a sardonic chapter title.</p><p> Some of the characters are more sympathetic, such as Renee Harris, who used the money she won suing the <i>Titanic</i> owners for her husband's death to bankroll neophyte playwright Moss Hart's first show. Lord says that Hart's memoir, <i>Act One</i>, depicts Harris reacting to an opening-night flop with optimism. After you've survived the <i>Titanic</i>, what's to worry?</p><p> Walter Lord has gotten better reviews, and he needn't fret about his reputation. The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Barbara Tuchman, author of <i>A Distant Mirror</i>, had this reaction to <i>Night Lives On</i>: "Stunning ... his detection and discoveries make a first-class historical reconstruction and a model in the research and writing of that difficult art." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Walter Lord received his B.A. in history from Princeton University in 1939. After war service in the OSS, he graduated from Yale Law School.

Here are accounts of revealing one&#39;s sexual identity to parents, siblings, friends, co-workers and, in one notable instance, to a stockbroker. Men tell of their first sexual encounters from their preteens to their thirties, with childhood friends who rejected or tenderly embraced them, with professors, with neighbors, with a Broadway star. These are poignant, sometimes unexpectedly funny tales of romance and heartbreak, repression and liberation, rape and first love defining moments that shaped their authors&#39; lives. Arranged chronologically from Manhattan in the Forties to San Francisco in the Nineties, these essays ultimately form a documentary of changing social and sexual mores in the United States--a literary, biographical, sociological and historical tour de force.</p><p>Patrick Merla edited two of the most influential gay publications in the United States: <em>Christopher Street</em> and <em>New York Native.</em> He is the author of <em>The Tales of Patrick Merla.</em> He lives New York City.A collection that transforms the ``coming out'' story, examining its meanings and challenging its conventions. Too often, ``coming out'' is a narrative formula rife with clich&#x201a;s and shortcuts that tend to underemphasize individual experience. This collection regrettably, does have its share of boys who ``always felt different.'' But most of these essays go far beyond such stock condensations. Allan Gurganus describes his erotic fascination with and love for Dan, a golf buddy of his father's, who ended up being arrested for fondling a young boy in a shopping mall restroom. Edmund White describes a trip to Acapulco with his stepmother and racist father, in which he loses his virginity to the hotel bar's Indian pianist. Some stories involve coming out to oneself: the specific crush or sexual experience that lets the narrator know he was homosexual. Others focus on the disclosure to others, usually parents, friends, or girlfriends, but David Drake amusingly relates coming out to his broker. The essays are arranged chronologically, a sound editorial choice, given that the dramatic changes--and equally startling continuities--in gay experience over the past 40 years make compelling stories in themselves. Samuel Delany provides a thoughtful analysis of the changing meanings of ``coming out''--at first, taken from the parlance of debutante balls, it referred to an entrance into gay society and gay life. Post-Stonewall, it meant ``coming out of the closet.'' The contributors to Boys Like Us intend both meanings and many more; this diversity of interpretation, as well as of prose styles and experience, is an important part of the anthology's richness. Not all of these essays are stellar, but there is enough truly artful material here to elevate the ``coming out'' story into a literary genre. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Brilliant, painful, dazzling, and funny as hell, Yellow Dog is Martin Amis' highly anticipated first novel in seven years and a stunning return to the fictional form. <br>When "dream husband" Xan Meo is vengefully assaulted in the garden of a London pub, he suffers head injury, and personality change. Like a spiritual convert, the familial paragon becomes an anti-husband, an anti-father. He submits to an alien moral system -- one among many to be found in these pages. We are introduced to the inverted worlds of the "yellow" journalist, Clint Smoker; the high priest of hardmen, Joseph Andrews; and the porno tycoon, Cora Susan. Meanwhile, we explore the entanglements of Henry England: his incapacitated wife, Pamela; his Chinese mistress, He Zhezun; his fifteen-year-old daughter, Victoria, the victim of a filmed "intrusion" that rivets the world -- because she is the future Queen of England, and her father, Henry IX, is its King. The connections between these characters provide the pattern and drive of Yellow Dog. <br>If, in the 21st century, the moral reality is changing, then the novel is changing too, whether it likes it or not. Yellow Dog is a model of how the novel, or more particularly the comic novel, can respond to this transformation. <br>But Martin Amis is also concerned here with what is changeless and perhaps unchangeable. Patriarchy, and the entire edifice of masculinity; the enormous category-error of violence, arising between man and man; the tortuous alliances between men and women; and the vanished dream (probably always an illusion, but now a clear delusion) that we can protect our future and our progeny. <br>"Meo heard no footsteps; what he heard was the swish, theshingly soft-shoe of the hefted sap. Then the sharp two-finger prod on his shoulder. It wasn't meant to happen like this. They expected him to turn and he didn't turn -- he half-turned, then veered and ducked. So the blow intended merely to break his cheekbone or his jawbone was instead received by the cranium, that spacey bulge (in this instance still quite marriageably forested) where so many delicate and important powers are so trustingly encased. <br>He crashed, he crunched to his knees, in obliterating defeat. . . . -- from Yellow Dog <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>Praise for Martin Amis</b>: <br>&#x201c;Mr. Amis is his generation&#x2019;s top literary dog. . . .

Here are three books for capturing small critters, Hammond's in colored pencils, Scott's in paints, and Wynne's in both. Hammond is a highly accomplished artist with several North Light books to her credit.

It's an excellent system for those intimidated by the variations of eyes, mouths, ears, and feet found on our furry companions. Scott's approach is for the advanced student who wants a more classically based style for painting rabbits, ferrets, mice, raccoons, and foxes. The influence of the Old Masters can be detected in her 41 mini-demonstrations and 16 full treatments in oil, acrylic, gouache, and pencil. Wynne is a British artist who has painted many well-known and royal pets, including the horses at the Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace. Hers is a lovely, loose style using either pencils or watercolors for cats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and horses. All three books are recommended and should prove popular.

Unlike Bernard Most's helpful reptiles ( If the Dinosaurs Came Back HBJ, 1978), Mansell's are true to their saurian natures: Diplodocus plucks houseplants from sixth-story windows; hungry Tyrannosaurus terrorizes a suburban neighborhood; Triceratops and Styracosaurus charge an armored truck. Innocent bystanders betray a mixture of emotions, from curiosity to alarm, while a wide-eyed boy looks on with wonder and delight. The front endpapers of this oversized volume introduce the 20 dinosaurs mentioned in the text (complete with phonetic spellings); the closing endpapers present 17 additional prehistoric reptiles ("can you imagine what it would be like if they came to town?"). Like his illustrations, Mansell's text is refreshingly earnest and jovial, its comical mix of fantasy and fact striking just the right note for the youngest of dinosaur fanciers.<br><i>- Marcia Hupp, Mamaroneck Free Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.This oversized, cartoony book invites youngsters to fantasize about the potential for disruption and upset if dinosaurs were to come back to today's world. In a series of detailed and jumbled landscapes, kids are treated to a relentless series of familiar tableaux now populated by a wide variety of pesky, sometimes threatening and destructive dinosaurs. The text merges facts about food choices and habitat with a strained story line--a device that ultimately falls flat. Most devoted dinosaur fans seem to prefer their facts unadorned with overly busy illustrations like those found here.

But the true story behind this legend is even more fantastic than the poem would have us believe. <br><br>Kublai Khan inherited the second largest land empire in history from his grandfather, Genghis Khan, and which he extended further, creating the biggest empire the world has ever seen; from China to Iraq, from Siberia to Afghanistan. His personal domain covered sixty-percent of all Asia, and one-fifth of the world&#x2019;s land area.<br><br>The West first learnt of this great Khan through the reports of Marco Polo. Kublai had not been born to rule, but had clawed his way to leadership, achieving power only in his 40s. He inherited Genghis Khan&#x2019;s great dream of world domination but unlike his grandfather he saw China and not Mongolia as the key to controlling power, and turned Genghis&#x2019;s unwieldy empire into a federation. Using China&#x2019;s great wealth, coupled with his shrewd and subtle governance, he created an empire that was the greatest since the fall of Rome, and shaped the modern world as we know it today. He gave China its modern-day borders and his legacy is that country&#x2019;s resurgence, and the superpower China of tomorrow.</p><p>John Man is a historian and travel writer with a special interest in Mongolia.

This book presents a rare collection of more than 100 of the best vintage New York City postcards, providing a snapshot of how much the Big Apple has changed&#x2014;and how much has remained recognizably the same. During the early years of the twentieth century, postcard photographers traveled the length and breadth of Manhattan snapping images and documenting landmarks and important new architectural masterpieces, such as the Singer Building (1908), the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower (1909), and the Woolworth Building (1913)&#x2014;each of which succeeded the other as the world&#x2019;s tallest building at the time of their respective completion. Also celebrated were the engineering feats of the Brooklyn Bridge and the elevated trains and early subway, as well as popular amusements such as the original Madison Square Garden and the Hippodrome, which occupied an entire city block at Longacre Square&#x2014;since renamed Times Square. Scenic views of the city from a distance were equally popular&#x2014;and in fact led to the coining of the word "skyline" in 1896. This charming keepsake volume is the perfect souvenir for architecture and history buffs and makes a wonderful gift.</p><p>Silvia and Stefano Lucchini are collectors based in Milan and New York whose unsurpassed collection of antique postcards inspired this book.

He has been a reviewer since 1965 (long for <i>Time</i> magazine), has written almost forty books on the subject, and has produced and directed thirty documentaries. He has counted as personal friends many of the leading filmmakers of the twentieth century. Call it &#x201c;obsession,&#x201d; &#x201c;lunacy,&#x201d; or a &#x201c;grand passion&#x201d; (Schickel grants all three), but there&#x2019;s simply no one who knows film better. Now Schickel gives us the ultimate summing up: a history of film as he&#x2019;s seen&#x2014;and lived&#x2014;it, a tour of his favorites, a master class in what makes a film soar or flop. <br><br> Schickel&#x2019;s no-holds-barred, often raucously irreverent opinions can range from panning classics, to spotlighting forgotten treasures, to defending the art of &#x201c;popular&#x201d; genres such as horror, westerns, screwball comedy, and noir. Beyond his picks and pans, Schickel offers a wealth of behind-the-scenes anecdotes (a love note from Marlene Dietrich, Frank Capra&#x2019;s unlikely path to success, <i>Annie Hall</i>&#x2019;s original title), career studies of our greatest performers and auteurs, and candidly intimate glimpses of his own life in pictures (an evening with Greta Garbo, John Ford&#x2019;s advice on directing, a &#x201c;dust-up&#x201d; in defense of Monty Python). <br><br> Above all, Schickel gives us a collection of the true gems, the immortal moments that have stuck with him over a lifetime of movie watching&#x2014;the transcendent scenes, characters, lines, shots, scores, even lighting cues that offer, each in their way, pure &#x201c;movie magic.&#x201d; Buster Keaton, <i>His Girl Friday</i>, Ingrid Bergman, <i>Taxi Driver</i>, <i>Star Wars</i>, Stanley Kubrick, <i>Pulp Fiction</i>&#x2014;Schickel reveals all the films and the forces behind them that have kept him coming back for more. <br> An essential addition to any cinephile&#x2019;s library, <i>Keepers </i>is the curation of a brilliant connoisseur and critic, but more than that, it&#x2019;s a love letter to film from one of its most dedicated devotees.</p><p><b>RICHARD SCHICKEL</b> is a film critic, documentary filmmaker, and movie historian. His books include <i>Conversations with Scorsese;</i> <i>Clint Eastwood: A Biography; Intimate Strangers: The Culture of Celebrity in America;</i> and <i>D. W. Griffith: An American Life. </i>His documentaries include <i>Charlie: The Life and Art of Charles Chaplin; Woody Allen: A Life in Film;</i> and <i>Shooting War,</i> about combat cameramen in World War II. He has held a Guggenheim Fellowship and was awarded the British Film Institute Book Prize, the Maurice Bessy Prize for film criticism, and the William K. Everson Award for his work in film history.1<br> Notes Toward the Definition of an Obsession<br><br> Some months ago, when I started to think about actually writing this book, as opposed to hemming and hawing as one generally does when a book is in the offing, I wondered how many movies I had actually seen in the course of the seventy-seven years since I saw my first film, <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, in 1938.<br><br> This was something more than an idle inquiry. I wanted to establish some kind of authority. As a result of my preferences in entertainment and, ultimately, my choice of profession, I had seen in the course of a lifetime a great many more films than all but a handful of people&#x2014;mostly professional reviewers&#x2014;had seen. But how many did that amount to? That was a question I had never addressed. &#x201c;A whole bunch,&#x201d; I am wont to say when people ask, which they quite often do; it is a slightly exotic way of making a living, and people seem idly curious about it.<br><br> It&#x2019;s obvious that I&#x2019;ve seen more than most people, for besides being a movie addict&#x2014;a fairly common condition, usually more or less cheerfully abandoned when family and work interrupt the addiction&#x2014;I became, more or less accidentally, a professional moviegoer. I began reviewing films in 1965. (I have done so, with only one significant hiatus, ever since.) By that time I had written a couple of books on them (and have written many more), and around 1968 I started making documentaries about them, an activity I pursued until quite recently. Throughout these years, I have continued my habit of slipping into movie theaters or screening rooms without having any professional rationale for so doing; I just like to be there in the dark watching something&#x2014;almost anything, if the truth be known. In this habit&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know if it is amiable or a mild, chronic illness&#x2014;I have been indulged by wives, girlfriends, just plain friends and children. Of course, a lot of the time I&#x2019;m alone, unashamedly killing an evening, no questions asked.<br><br> Here I have to enter a caveat: I am an <i>American</i> critic. I have dutifully, mostly happily, seen thousands of films of foreign origin. They are among the most rewarding moviegoing experiences of my life. But this twig was bent early. I know more about American films, historically and aesthetically, than I do about those from other lands. I&#x2019;ve sought to remedy that defect, of course, and I&#x2019;ve done reasonably well with it. But, yes, I am more comfortable, more authoritative, with American movies. In reading critics from those other countries, in turn, I notice some discomfort when they deal with our films.<br><br> Funny thing. When I started reviewing in the 1960s, the movies were a young art. We were less than forty years into the age of the &#x201c;talkies&#x201d; and perhaps sixty years into the age of the feature film. It occurred to me&#x2014;preposterously, I admit&#x2014;that you could, if you worked demonically, become a scholar of world cinema, knowing something about movies from everywhere. In fact, I am still playing catch-up with the cinema of many countries. It&#x2019;s like being a perpetual grad student, swotting up what you need to know to write a respectable piece when the occasion becomes pressing, which very often becomes fascinating and instructive work.<br><br> Because I turned pro in the mid-sixties, most of my omissions can be partially justified by the demands of wearing too many hats. You cannot write a book or make a television show about the movies without seeing films anew&#x2014;no matter how often you&#x2019;ve seen the ones you are taking up in these projects. Movies, obviously, do not change substantively, although nowadays, with the rise of directors&#x2019; cuts and specialists pawing through the archives finding new material that had been eliminated before the answer print&#x2014;the &#x201c;official&#x201d; one&#x2014;was struck, movies can change more than we thought they could a decade or two ago. I was involved in such a transformative project a few years ago, restoring some forty minutes of Sam Fuller&#x2019;s <i>The Big Red One</i>&#x2014;whole scenes of which were rescued from a Warner warehouse in Kansas City. I think this version of the film is way better than what was circulating before&#x2014;it has now the weight of a heartfelt epic; it is not just another war picture. And it honors the intentions of its very honorable director. Anyway, we won some prizes for our work and the good opinion of moviegoing mankind. But I noticed this: People who had been content with the short version were not as enthusiastic about our cut. It was nice and all that, but the bastard version was perfectly okay with them. Finished films, even when everyone knows they could be better, exert a powerful inertial force on the object at hand.<br><br> I have found that what I guess could be called my gross judgment of a movie does not often change with the passing years. If I liked it once, I&#x2019;ll probably still like it now&#x2014;but with an asterisk. You will notice things that make it rise or fall in your estimation, based on your experience and the passing years. And, naturally, you see other films (and read books and articles) that impinge on your feelings for the ones you are reconsidering. So you owe to your readers or viewers&#x2014;not to mention yourself&#x2014;a report on the state of your current feelings as you encounter and re-encounter movies in the course of your lifelong engagement with them.<br><br>Rarely, as I&#x2019;ve said, do you flip from love to hate or vice versa. But changes do occur. It&#x2019;s logical. You loved <i>My Friend Flicka</i> when you saw it at age ten. If you see it at age sixty-five, you may respect it, but you won&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a masterpiece (which does not mean you should deprive your grandchildren of the pleasure of seeing this picture when they are the perfect age for it).<br><br> Remarkably, Pauline Kael thought this was not so. She might have seen a film when she was ten years old, and she might be writing about it as a sixty-five-year-old, but that made no difference to her. It was what it was, world without end. She was sometimes wont to say it was like an old fuck&#x2014;forever frozen in memory&#x2019;s amber. I don&#x2019;t think the argument applies to fucking, and I don&#x2019;t think it applies to movies, either. Memory has a way of playing tricks on us&#x2014;even Pauline&#x2019;s, whose recall for films was capacious.<br><br> That discussion is for later. Now it&#x2019;s time to start counting. That is pretty easy in the early years. There was <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, naturally, and what I still think is my first viewed masterpiece, <i>Pinocchio</i>, and a whole slew of other Disney titles (<i>Dumbo</i>, <i>Bambi</i> and, God help us, <i>Saludos Amigos</i>). There were other treats as well&#x2014;birthday party items (my own and others&#x2019;) and some special events, like <i>The Great Dictator </i>(which my parents thought I should see, although I understood very little of it at the time), and <i>Harmon of Michigan</i>, about the famous football player (Tom, father of the television actor Mark), which I insisted on seeing on a school night, no less. There was no regularity in this&#x2014;no rhyme or reason, either. But by the time I was nine or ten I was probably going to the movies once every week or two.<br><br> Shortly after that, the movies became a more serious habit. There were two sub-run theaters&#x2014;as opposed to first-run&#x2014;within walking distance of my house, and two regular companions who lived on my block and liked the movies as much as I did. Friday nights or Sunday afternoons, Danny Seifert or Kenny Siegesmund and I, or all three of us, trotted off to the movies almost without fail, not much caring what was playing and pretty much liking everything we saw, no genres excluded.<br><br> I don&#x2019;t suppose those two friends kept up this habit later in life, but I did. Let&#x2019;s say that from the time I became a teenager until the day before yesterday, I have seen at least two movies a week. When I was a kid, my mother, who liked to shop in downtown Milwaukee, would of a summer&#x2019;s afternoon park me in one of the several first-run downtown theaters, armed with candy and popcorn, while she pursued her bliss. It was&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll have to take my word on this&#x2014;completely safe. Ushers were everywhere. Later, we would meet at my father&#x2019;s office and go out for hamburgers. I&#x2019;m not sure I was ever happier than at the movies those days. If you multiply two movies a week by sixty-nine years, you come out at around 7,000 movies in all, as a baseline&#x2014;a not inconsiderable sum, especially when we are told that the average American of my age nowadays sees only four movies a year in a theater.<br><br> When I went to the University of Wisconsin, I basically doubled my moviegoing. Yes, four of them a week. It was easy. There were four or five movie theaters on State Street and Capitol Square in Madison, and one repaired there regularly for the current releases. The university, which now has a rather distinguished film department, at that time offered no courses in film, practical or theoretical. But a small theater in the student union functioned as an art house on the weekends, playing mostly the latest releases from abroad. (There was not much in the way of American independent films in those days.) I missed very few of those pictures. On Thursday afternoons this theater played classic titles of the past, and it was at these screenings that I saw for the first time&nbsp;<i>Intolerance</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Metropolis</i>&nbsp;and Buster Keaton and the Russian and French classics of the twenties and thirties.<br><br> I was making up my own mind about all the films, unguided by the academic scholarship of the era. What we had for authority was Paul Rotha&#x2019;s latest edition of&nbsp;<i>The Film Till Now,</i>&nbsp;which was considerably better than nothing, though kind of so-so on American cinema. What <i>I</i>&nbsp;had was something like 100 more movies per annum and, in my last year, a founding membership in a film club, which for our enrichment played Leni Riefenstahl&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Olympia</i>&nbsp;and for our profitability played&nbsp;<i>Ecstasy.</i>&nbsp;Imagine that! Hedy Lamarr, a minor, but an authentic MGM star, jaybird naked in the dappled forests of Czechoslovakia! Movies occasionally are wondrous things.<br><br> And the gift that keeps on giving. After I graduated, I moved to New York, where I went to work for a few years as a staff writer on magazines. I didn&#x2019;t know many people. I didn&#x2019;t have a television set. But I lived in Greenwich Village, which was Madison on steroids. That is to say, it had plenty of movie theaters&#x2014;the Sheridan for second-runs of current releases, the Art (for art), the Waverly (for repertory), the Greenwich for odds and ends. I fed my habit as I had in Madison&#x2014;a couple hundred movies a year. Five years of college plus five years of&#x2014;I guess you&#x2019;d call it bohemia&#x2014;adds up to another 1,000 movies. So by the time I married, at age twenty-seven&#x2014;to a woman who shared my moviegoing passion&#x2014;I was already on track for a lifetime total of 8,000 films, give or take.<br><br> And I was not yet a professional moviegoer. That occurred in 1965, when, at first casually, then not so casually, I began reviewing for&nbsp;<i>Life</i>magazine. I persisted there until it folded, in 1972, then I moved over to&nbsp;<i>Time,</i>&nbsp;where I lasted until 2009. I took some time off and then landed an agreeable job at a website called&nbsp;Truthdig.com. So in my fifty or so years of reviewing, I&#x2019;ve added 10,000 movies to my total, which works out to 18,000 titles in sum.<br><br> But we are not finished. From 1965 to date, I&#x2019;ve written thirty-seven books and made the same number of television documentaries, mostly about the movies. I&#x2019;d guess each of those enterprises has entailed seeing (or re-seeing) around thirty-five films&#x2014;2,590 of them in all. In addition, I&#x2019;ve done all sorts of shorter films and articles for a variety of occasions, and it&#x2019;s probably safe to say I saw another thousand movies in the course of those activities. And then there were speeches and TV appearances for which I took in even more&nbsp;movies, and there were film festivals, of course&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t like them; too many bad movies in a short span of time&#x2014;which quickly added substantially to the total, probably another thousand or so.<br><br> For a grand total of, shall we say, 22,590 movies, or about 294 of them a year. Which means that two out of every three days, for a long time now, I have been at the movies.<br><br> I suppose you could say that I have overdone it, but I have nearly always had a good time doing what I do. I&#x2019;m not great at quoting immortal lines from famous films (most critics aren&#x2019;t; that&#x2019;s a specialty of amateur enthusiasts) or referring to great scenes at apposite moments. But I think I&#x2019;ve been able to see movies unblinkered&#x2014;and in the end, that&#x2019;s what this book&#x2019;s about. It contains reflections on a large number of movies that are, by any standard, masterpieces. It is silent about a large number of movies that are significant milestones in the history of the art that I have no interest in seeing ever again, because, quite frankly, they are ponderous, or running on reputations that have not been reexamined in decades, or prisoners of styles that are no longer relevant&#x2014;to me at least.<br><br> I want to make this point about moviegoing: It includes for me a lot of things that are not, strictly speaking, about going to the movies. The truth, very simply, is that most movies are lousy or, at best, routine. We go to see them, much of the time, in search of something else&#x2014;the comforting darkness of the theater, the play of light and shadow on the screen, the consolations they offer for some temporary trouble. A lot of the time we don&#x2019;t give a hoot what&#x2019;s playing. We are at a public event for private reasons, which we don&#x2019;t always recognize until later, if at all. It is the occasion, the atmosphere, that we crave. The art of the film has to break through our preoccupations and distractions if it is to somehow seize us. Come to think of it, the amazing thing about movies is how often that happens, not how rarely.<br><br> So back to counting&#x2014;22,250 movies. Not many of them were&nbsp;pleasurable at any level, but you learn as much about film from the bad ones as you do from the good ones. Thankfully, there are enough of the latter to make this book a feasible undertaking. W.&nbsp;H. Auden, in one of his superb critical essays, wrote that masterpieces are for the &#x201c;High Holidays of the Spirit,&#x201d; suggesting that the intensity of the responses they engender is not something that we can freely indulge. It would be too much for us, put too much pressure on us. We need the routine, the merely all right, if only as a benchmark against which to measure the extraordinary when it happens along.</p><h2>Winged Dagger: Adventures on Special Service</h2><p>An eccentric and charismatic officer, Roy Farran rose to command an SAS squadron during World War II.

John Harrison, is an English author and critic. His work includes the <i>Viriconium</i> sequence of novels and short stories, (1982), <i>Climbers</i> (1989), and the <i>Kefahuchi Tract</i> series which begins with Light (2002).<br>An unspoken secret that warps the lives of three Cambridge graduates is a springboard into mysteries of the heart and spirit in British author Harrison's enigmatic dark fantasy. Lucas Medlar, Pam Stuyvesant and the novel's unnamed narrator are all middle-aged intellectuals mired in the entropy of their lives. Lucas and Pam are in a deteriorating marriage, and the narrator uses work as a refuge from family and friends. All three are beholden to Yaxley, a creepy acquaintance from their schooldays who shows up periodically, always speaking in metaphysical riddles about a sensual realm called "the Pleroma." Meanwhile, Lucas entertains Pam with a fanciful history of "the Coeur," a symbol-laden quest that spans centuries and continents and is linked to the understanding of the Pleroma. The meaning of the Pleroma and the Coeur, and how they relate to visions of awe and terror that taunt all three characters over the course of the story, are just part of the weird aura that cloaks all the novel's events and points back to a strange shared experience from their youth. Harrison (<i>Things That Never Happen</i>) tantalizes the reader with explanations that are always just out of reach, and this sense of imminent revelation heightens the tale's mystery and suspense. Readers who like fantasies tinged with the transcendent will find much to enjoy. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Q. Why are English train seats so narrow? A. It&#39;s all the Romans&#39; fault. The first Victorian trains were built to the same width as horse-drawn wagons; and they were designed to fit the ruts left in the roads by Roman chariots. For readers of Paxman&#39;s The English, Bryson&#39;s Notes on a Small Island and Fox&#39;s Watching the English, this intriguing and witty book explains how our national characteristics - our sense of humour, our hobbies, our favourite foods and our behaviour with the opposite sex - are all defined by our nation&#39;s extraordinary geography, geology, climate and weather. You will learn how we would be as freezing cold as Siberia without the Gulf Stream; why we drive on the left-hand side of the road; why the Midlands became the home of the British curry. It identifies the materials that make England, too: the faint pink Aberdeen granite of kerbstones; that precise English mix of air temperature, smell and light that hits you the moment you touch down at Heathrow.

Interior very clean and crisp.</p><p><i>Look Homeward, Angel</i> is an elaborate and moving coming-of-age story about Eugene Gant, a restless and energetic character whose passion to experience life takes him from his small, rural hometown in North Carolina to Harvard University and the city of Boston. The novel's pattern is artfully simple -- a small town, a large family, high school and college -- yet the characters are monumental in their graphic individuality and personality. <p> Through his rich, ornate prose, Wolfe evokes the extraordinarily vivid family of the Gants, and with equal detail, the remarkable peculiarities of small-town life and the pain and upheaval of a boy who must leave both. A classic work of American literature, Look Homeward, Angel is a passionate, stirring, and unforgettable novel. </p>Thomas Wolfe (1900&#x2013;1938) was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and educated at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University.

Friedman Photographs, 1976-1991</h2><p>Now in it's fifth printing, Fuck You Heroes is photographer Glen E. Friedman's uncompromising look at the radicals of youth culture in the extreme worlds of skateboarding, punk and rap. From day one behind his camera, Friedman has had an unerring ability to be in the right place ahead of everybody else. He was a teenaged photographer for 'Thrasher' and 'Skateboarder' magazines, he created the seminal one-hit punk fanzine 'My Rules', worked with Black Flag and Suicidal Tendencies in their early days, wrote for Maximum Rock &amp; Roll, did street promotion for Def Jam's west coast office and shot sleeve photos for everyone from Minor Threat to Public Enemy. This book presents the photographic distillation of Glen's ethic: it's about the perfect shots of the people who live by the touchstones of intensity and integrity.</p><p>This classic book, my first hardcover, as well as <b>FUCK YOU TOO</b> is currently out of print, Well worth finding if you can. <br><br>That said the 2014 release of <b>MY RULES</b> (<i>the book</i>) will contain most of the best photographs from both <b>FUCK YOU HEROES </b>and <b>FUCK YOU TOO,</b> together in it's huge, 324 pages, as well as many additional photographs never before seen, unearthed classics from the archives.It&#39;s all about energy. There are infinite means and methods, but with the best in any field, it is energy that is the constant. It&#39;s what makes the great stuff great, and the rest stand to the side. Perhaps the truest characteristic of human nature is the need to push it further than the last bunch did. Sometimes it&#39;s the only reason I can find for getting up in the morning. The ones who feel the need to break through barriers, who have nothing but contempt for limitations and average expectations; this book captures them in their element.Glen E. Friedman has been capturing outbursts of energy for nearly two decades. I knew Glen&#39;s work well before I met him. All my friends andI used to stare at his photos in skate magazines and wonder how he got that shot at that moment. After knowing Glen for over 13 years, I understand how he does it. Glen is an energy addict. He captured the peak era of the original heavy &#34;Dogtown&#34; street skaters. He worked on the first Black Flag video. He produced the first Suicidal Tendencies album. He intoduced me to the Beastie Boys when they only had a 7&#34; single out. He gave me a tape of Public Enemy when Chuck D was DJ&#39;ing in college. He documented the rise of the mighty Def Jam label and some of the musicians who changed the face of music forever. The bottom line is he was there at the beginning of so much stuff it&#39;s not funny.Art meets action. Art becomes action. There are no admitted heroes here. Just those who have and know what to do with it. It&#39;s all about energy. Glen works on instinct. He gets it, he&#39;s got it. The photos contained here are the evidence.

There were surprises all right, and there were other developments that one who has examined a number of UFO cases comes to expect but which are extremely bizarre to the witness when he experiences them for the first time. </p><p> Like all UFO cases, without exception, there are very strange aspects to this long-term on-going series of contact events, evidence for which is highly elusive. We have tried to deal with the evidence that could be examined and tested in an objective manner, always keeping in mind a sincere conviction that a given item of evidence demonstrably valid does not make the rest valid any more than a false lead makes it all false. We have encountered spectacular truths as well as spectacular misperceptions and misunderstandings all in this one case. </p><p> If anything in particular could be said about this case that sets it apart from all others, it would be the great amount of evidence available for testing and the unusually large number of participating witnesses to these events as they unfolded. </p><p> I feel as qualified as any outsider to report this very extensive UFO contact case because I have maintained a very close contact with it and all the principals involved for five years, and have lived with them on their property for over 71 days in all.</p></p><p></p><h2>Shorebirds of the Pacific Northwest</h2><p>Identifies over sixty species of shorebirds found between British Columbia and western Montana, discussing behavior, habitat, and molting patterns</p><p>This unique reference offers a wealth of information to satisfy the expert as much as to stimulate the intermediate and beginning birder.<strong>Dennis Paulson</strong> is director of the Slater Museum of Natural History at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. <strong>Jim Erckmann</strong> (illustrator) is watershed manager of the Cedar River watershed for the Seattle Water Department.

She lives in Northern California and teaches creative writing in Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program.<p></p><p>On the last day of August in 1970, and a month shy of her fourteenth birthday, Jory&#x2019;s father drove his two daughters out to an abandoned house and left them there.</p><p>The trip had not taken long. Her father piloted the car with resolute determination toward the very edge of town. He drove past the railroad tracks and the fish hatchery and the rodeo grounds, past the sugar beet factory and the slaughterhouse and the meatpacking plant; all the while Jory stared out the window in a silent fury. Next to her in the Buick&#x2019;s backseat, Grace was practically unconscious. She lay slumped over with her head resting accidentally on Jory&#x2019;s shoulder, her drool dampening the upper portion of Jory&#x2019;s T-shirt. Jory gave her sister a shove and then turned toward the window. Black Cat Lane and Chicken Dinner Road and Floating Feather rolled past&#x2014;long, twisty lanes sided with fields of sugar beets and alfalfa and corn. Jory watched a lone mallard drop and skid like a bomber onto an irrigation ditch while three goats perched king of the hill&#x2013;style on a salvaged roof a farmer had put out for them. Her father continued on past several vast silagey-smelling feedlots, and then the fields grew even larger and the scenery more sparse and the houses less frequent, and finally he turned down a narrow unpaved lane that Jory had never seen before. Then he stopped the car and opened the door. Jory refused to look up at the strange house where she and her sister were now to live. She sat in the backseat with her hands between her knees until her father pulled her forcibly out of the car and set her on her feet in the dirt.</p><p>The house of their exile was ancient and dilapidated, its white siding weather warped, its roof&#x2019;s shingles curling and covered with moss. And below the sharp peak of the house&#x2019;s second story, an enormous diamond-shaped window stared out from its gable like the jack of diamond&#x2019;s lonely eye. But it wasn&#x2019;t the condition of the house that mattered, Jory knew, as much as its location. The house was safely hidden away on a back acre of Idaho farmland, far from any schools or churches or stores or neighborhoods. And it was this isolation for which Jory&#x2019;s father had paid. Privacy was of the utmost importance now, he had said. Or perhaps more correctly, the word he was looking for was <i>secrecy</i>.</p><p>Her father unwedged the few taped-together boxes from the Buick&#x2019;s trunk. One at a time, he carried them up the house&#x2019;s peeling green steps and deposited them onto the living room floor. Jory stood holding the screen door open and taking occasional, unwilling peeks at the dim interior of the house. A brown couch sagged dead-cat-like against one wall. The portion of the floor she could see from the doorway was made of sloping hardwood, and was partly covered by a gray flowered rug that must have been bride-beautiful at some point a very long time ago. Jory heard the car door slam. After a second, her sister came wandering up the porch steps. Grace leaned against the door frame for a moment and then wobbled toward the couch, where she proceeded to lie down on her side, her face buried against one of the sofa&#x2019;s armrests.</p><p>&#x201c;I think that about does it.&#x201d; Her father wiped his hands down the front of his khaki pants. &#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; he said, gazing about the room. &#x201c;There you are.&#x201d;</p><p>Jory gave him a hard, bright look. &#x201c;Here we are.&#x201d;</p><p>He searched for something in his pockets. He whistled &#x201c;Red River Valley&#x201d; and patted down his shirtfront, and then his pants pockets. &#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; He held up a small silver key. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be needing this.&#x201d; He smiled and handed it to her.</p><p>Without looking at the key, Jory tossed it onto the top of one of the unopened boxes.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, now,&#x201d; her father said in his calmest voice. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to lose that.&#x201d; After walking over to the cardboard box and retrieving the key, he handed it to her once more, this time pressing it into her palm and closing her fingers firmly around it.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have another one?&#x201d; She inspected his face.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Mom and I will keep an extra, of course.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;Just in case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just in case?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and don&#x2019;t forget, there&#x2019;s milk and things that need to go in the fridge. Also, the front door may stick a little when you first try to open it, so you&#x2019;ll have to shove hard and jiggle the handle up and down.&#x201d; He demonstrated and then paused, waiting for a look of recognition that Jory refused to give. &#x201c;Okay, well, I&#x2019;ll be back to check on you in a day or two. I think Grace&#x2019;s correspondence course books should be here by then, so I&#x2019;ll bring them along.&#x201d; He studied the ceiling the way he always did when he needed hope or inspiration. &#x201c;You might want to get Grace into bed. The doctor gave her a little something to calm her down. A shot or a pill or something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I noticed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, ignoring her tone and marching on, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve got just about everything here.&#x201d; He cast a proprietary glance around the room. &#x201c;I think you girls are all set. Really. I think that about does it.&#x201d;</p><p>She stood and stared at him. His smile seemed sewn in place.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad.&#x201d;</p><p>He stepped toward her and then pulled her head tight against his chest. For a moment she listened to his huge heart&#x2019;s muffled thumping. Then she could feel him sigh. He stepped back and put his hands on either side of her face. Bending down, he pressed his lips against a spot in the middle of her forehead. &#x201c;JoryAnne,&#x201d; he whispered, and then touched the spot firmly with the tip of his finger, as if sealing the kiss into place.</p><p>She had a sudden impulse to slap him.</p><p>Jory sat on one of the boxes with her back to the door, and as her father pulled the Buick out onto the roadway she could smell the dust that drifted up in the wake of his leaving. For a moment she remained like this, and then with a start she jumped up and scrambled toward the house&#x2019;s stairway, leaping up the steps to the second-floor landing and its diamond-shaped window. Breathless, she hung on to the window&#x2019;s angled frame and peered out. The glass was slightly wavy and thick, but she could see everything below: the sway of a giant willow, the branches of a plum tree set to shaking by old men crows already drunk on its rotting fruit, the steady trajectory of her father&#x2019;s green Buick disappearing down the graveled country road. She watched, unmoving, until the last of the car&#x2019;s comet tail of dust evaporated into the late afternoon air. Then she sank down onto her knees on the hardwood floor. This high perch made her feel removed and above, as far away as banished maidens locked in smoothed-stone towers. Forever gazing down, they waited for nothing, for knights who were already dead and wouldn&#x2019;t be coming.</p><p>That first night she refused to sleep in either of the two iron-framed beds. She didn&#x2019;t unpack any of the boxes either. As it grew dark, she covered Grace with a red plaid blanket and then moved out onto the back porch and sat on its wooden floor with a wedding quilt she&#x2019;d found on one of the beds wrapped around her. <i>I John 4:7&#x2014;Beloved, let us love one another,</i> the quilt admonished in embroidered script, courtesy of Laveeta Lamar Hicks. <i>John 15:13&#x2014;Greater love hath no man, </i>proclaimed Eleanor Genevieve Doerksen. <i>Let love be your greatest aim&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For God so loved the world&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Love never fails.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fuck you. And you. And you.&#x201d; Jory twisted the quilt around to its other side. Here there were no Bible sayings, only endless twining circles&#x2014;wedding rings stitched carefully in pink and gold thread. She ran her hand over the puckered material. How many days and nights did it take to sew something like this? And did each woman do her own portion separately, or did they gather over a long sewing table in someone&#x2019;s living room and talk as they worked? And why did they do it anyway? Look where it had ended up. They were all dead, the quiltmakers and the bride, and their painstakingly stitched words meant nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing.</p><p>She pulled the quilt tighter around her shoulders. Something about the way she was sitting, hunched and small, reminded her of how once when she was little, to spite her mother, she had hidden beneath a table in the back corner of the public library. She had watched from behind the table&#x2019;s great carved wooden leg as her mother stood in line, checked out her books, and then calmly set off for the drugstore with Jory&#x2019;s two sisters in tow. Jory had come out from her hiding place then, smacking her head hard on the table edge in her hurry, just in time to see the three of them walking past the glass doors of the library and on down the sidewalk, her little sister occasionally stooping to scratch at something on her knee.</p><p>Jory was quite sure that she had forgotten that incident completely. She glared up at the sky and the points of the stars blurred together. She cried then, a few big, splintered sobs, and pounded at the porch&#x2019;s floorboards with her bare heels over and over until finally, wondrously, it hurt enough to stop. She rocked back and forth hugging her knees, holding her bruised feet carefully off the floor while her chest seized, her lungs catching at frayed threads of air. She wiped her nose on a corner of the quilt, and then held still listening. The night air hummed with the same happy insects. A farm or two away a dog barked, and then barked again. She was still here. Nothing had changed. What had she expected? She tipped slowly over onto her side, clutching the quilt, and let her face slide against the cool of the painted wood porch. <i>God is love, </i>she thought. <i>For God so loved the world.</i></p><p>The sunlight slanted through the screen of the porch, warming her face and bringing the gradual knowledge that she was somewhere strange and that her neck was now very sore. She sat up slowly. Several parts of her body ached from a night on the wood floor. Her feet in particular, and the backs of her heels. She stepped over the heap of quilt and marched into the house, letting the screen door whap shut behind her. Inside the doorway, though, she stopped and stood.</p><p>In the morning light, the kitchen looked as if someone had cut its angles out with left-handed scissors, and it smelled like cat food and old bleach, or damp, many-eyed potatoes. Jory walked slowly from the wide double sink to the prehistoric gas stove, and then to the linoleum-topped kitchen table. She was supposed to live here in this place, in this peculiar old house that smelled like someone else&#x2019;s cast-off life. She could feel herself breathing in an irregular way, as if she had to concentrate in order to make her lungs expand and relax.</p><p>She walked into the living room. Grace was lying on the dead cat couch still wearing her tennis shoes and snoring softly beneath the plaid blanket. The unopened boxes squatted in a circle around them. One of the boxes had a large paper sack on top that was leaking something pink and white. A large blossom-colored pool had formed around the bag and was now dripping down the side of the box. Cherry vanilla. He&#x2019;d always bought it for her when she was sick or sad. Once, when Jory had to have stitches, he brought the whole carton into her bedroom wrapped in a dishtowel and fed her one spoonful after another while he explained how scar tissue formed. How even the stars healed themselves. He had been wearing a tie with small green ducks on it.</p><p>Jory found one of her tennis shoes under the couch and the other near the front door. She crammed them onto her feet without untying the laces. After one glance back at her sister, she fled out the door and down the painted steps, the backs of her bruised heels burning like fire.</p><p>The road that led away from the house was lined with cottonwood trees, and little bits of the fluff blew all around her and clung to her hair as she strode fast and faster past weedy patches and fields of corn and late summer wheat. She passed a barn that had faded to an unidentifiable color. A large spotted dog lay panting in a strip of shade beneath the barn&#x2019;s overhang. The dog inspected her; it raised its wedge-shaped head and blinked slowly, but did not get up. Jory kept walking. Once, she turned around to look behind her, and still, even at this distance, she could see the house&#x2019;s diamond-shaped window winking at her in the late morning sun.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t noticed the heat. The blood now hummed in her head as she marched along, kicking up spits of loose gravel. The flat string of road ran on ahead for as far as she could see, shimmering and wavering a little at its farthest point. Jory made a half-strangled noise deep in her throat and sat down hard next to the edge of the road. A drain ditch bristling with cattails rushed foamily past her feet.</p><p>The wind began to blow in short, dry little gusts that she could feel in the sweaty sections of her hair. A large crow sailed past and then landed clumsily on the thick stalk of a cattail. The bird maneuvered briefly, attempting to vary its grip in hopes of a stronger foothold, but quickly gave up and flapped on. Jory stood and peered toward the road. A rounded truck the color of curdled milk was coming toward her. She stared as it passed her, and then suddenly with a bump and a sigh it pulled off onto the road&#x2019;s steep shoulder and came to a stop. She could hear a crow squawking insistently somewhere overhead. The truck reversed gears and backed up slowly to the spot where she was standing. AL&#x2019;S FROZEN ICE CREAM TREATS<i>,</i> the truck&#x2019;s passenger side read. TASTY AND DELICIOUS! The man inside was already leaning across the seat to open the door. &#x201c;Miss your bus?&#x201d; he said, smiling. The truck&#x2019;s front seat was high above her and she had to grab at the crease-hardened hand he offered down. With a powerful pull he hoisted her firmly up onto the cab&#x2019;s slick vinyl seat.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, hello there,&#x201d; he said. He raked his blue-tattooed fingers through his ponytailed hair and made no move toward going anywhere.</p><p>Jory stared out through the windshield at the road she had just come down, and then behind her at the tiny diamond-windowed house nearly hidden in the trees. She could feel the back of her throat suddenly swelling hot and tight with tears. &#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Where <i>were</i> you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;in between selling delicious ice cream treats, I&#x2019;ve been busy scouring the landscape for <i>you</i>.&#x201d; He rested his elbow on the seatback and with one finger pushed a stray strand of her hair behind her ear. For a second, neither of them moved. Then he reached out and pulled all of her past the gearshift and onto his lap. She sat sideways across his hard legs and leaned her head against his shirt, breathing in his smell. It was the same as always&#x2014;engine grease and cigarette smoke and something unidentifiable that she always thought of as burned sugar. She closed her eyes. Through his chest she could hear him humming a song she didn&#x2019;t know. He held her carefully with one arm and she could feel his muscles tense as he put the truck into gear and then steered them back out onto the road. He flicked the switch on the loudspeaker and as the truck jounced along music played above her like a carnival tune from a faraway fair, a tinkling gypsy music as strange as a blue tattoo. It followed them like a long holiday all the way down the road to wherever it was they were going.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Part ...</p></p><h2>The Floor of Heaven: A True Tale of the American West and the Yukon Gold Rush (Thorndike Press Large Print Nonfiction)</h2><p>The author of the Edgar Award-winning American Lightning traces the experiences of 1890s prospector-turned-tycoon George Carmack, cowboy detective Charlie Siringo and gold-rush underworld con man Soapy Smith to reveal how the opening of the &#34;last frontier&#34; in Alaska shaped America&#39;s national character.

Bad information means bad treatment decisions, which means patients suffer and die: there is no climactic moment of villainy, but drugs are used which are overpriced, less effective, and have more side effects. There are five cheap, easy things we can do to fix the problem. <i>Bad Pharma </i>takes a big dirty secret out into the open, and will provide a single focus for concerns people have both inside and outside medicine.</p></p><p>BEN GOLDACRE is a doctor and award-winning science writer who has written the Bad Science column in the <i>Guardian</i> since 2003.

This is our core premise, and you&#x2019;re about to read a very short chapter, because this is one of the most well-documented phenomena in the growing field of &#x2018;research about research&#x2019;. It has also become much easier to study in recent years, because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer. <br>We can begin with some recent work: in 2010, three researchers from Harvard and Toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug &#x2013; antidepressants, ulcer drugs and so on &#x2013; then measured two key features: were they positive, and were they funded by industry?1 They found over five hundred trials in total: 85 per cent of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50 per cent of the government-funded trials were. That&#x2019;s a very significant difference. <br>In 2007, researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin.2 These are cholesterol-lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack, they are prescribed in very large quantities, and they will loom large in this book. This study found 192 trials in total, either comparing one statin against another, or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment. Once the researchers controlled for other factors (we&#x2019;ll delve into what this means later), they found that industry-funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug. Again, that&#x2019;s a very big difference. <br>We&#x2019;ll do one more. In 2006, researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten-year period, finding 542 trial outcomes in total. Industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time, while independently funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases. If you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor&#x2019;s drug in a trial, you were in for a pretty rough ride: you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time.3 <br>These are dismal, frightening results, but they come from individual studies. When there has been lots of research in a field, it&#x2019;s always possible that someone &#x2013; like me, for example &#x2013; could cherry-pick the results, and give a partial view. I could, in essence, be doing exactly what I accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing, and only telling you about the studies that support my case, while hiding the reassuring ones from you. <br>To guard against this risk, researchers invented the systematic review. We&#x2019;ll explore this in more detail soon (here), since it&#x2019;s at the core of modern medicine, but in essence a systematic review is simple: instead of just mooching through the research literature, consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre-existing beliefs, you take a scientific, systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence, ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done. <br>Systematic reviews are very, very onerous. In 2003, by coincidence, two were published, both looking specifically at the question we&#x2019;re interested in. They took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro-industry results. Each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers, and both found that industry-funded trials were, overall, about four times more likely to report positive results.4 A further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews: it found twenty more pieces of work, and all but two showed that industry-sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results.5 <br>I am setting out this evidence at length because I want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue. Industry-sponsored trials give favourable results, and that is not my opinion, or a hunch from the occasional passing study. This is a very well-documented problem, and it has been researched extensively, without anybody stepping out to take effective action, as we shall see. <br>There is one last study I&#x2019;d like to tell you about. It turns out that this pattern of industry-funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers, and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences, where data often appears for the first time (in fact, as we shall see, sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference, with very little information on how the study was conducted). <br>Fries and Krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 American College of Rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial, and acknowledged industry sponsorship, in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor&#x2019;s drug. There is a small punchline coming, and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like. In general, the results section is extensive: the raw numbers are given for each outcome, and for each possible causal factor, but not just as raw figures. The &#x2018;ranges&#x2019; are given, subgroups are perhaps explored, statistical tests are conducted, and each detail of the result is described in table form, and in shorter narrative form in the text, explaining the most important results. This lengthy process is usually spread over several pages. <br>In Fries and Krishnan [2004] this level of detail was unnecessary. The results section is a single, simple, and &#x2013; I like to imagine &#x2013; fairly passive-aggressive sentence: <br>The results from every RCT (45 out of 45) favored the drug of the sponsor. <br>This extreme finding has a very interesting side effect, for those interested in time-saving shortcuts. Since every industry-sponsored trial had a positive result, that&#x2019;s all you&#x2019;d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome: if it was funded by industry, you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great. <br>How does this happen? How do industry-sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result? It is, as far as anyone can be certain, a combination of factors. It may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they&#x2019;re most confident their treatment is going to &#x2018;win&#x2019;: this sounds reasonable, although even it conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there&#x2019;s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best (otherwise you&#x2019;re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior). Sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased by outright design flaws. You can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish &#x2013; an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. You can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. You can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good (which is &#x2013; for interesting reasons we shall discuss &#x2013; statistical poison). And so on. <br>But before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks, these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not, there is something very much simpler at hand. <br>Sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it&#x2019;s not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades. <br>In fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today &#x2013; right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation &#x2013; that still wouldn&#x2019;t help, because we would still be practising medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is &#x2013; as you&#x2019;ve now seen &#x2013; fundamentally distorted. <br>But there is a way ahead. <br>Why missing data matters <br>Reboxetine is a drug I myself have prescribed. Other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient, so we wanted to try something new. I&#x2019;d read the trial data before I wrote the prescription, and found only well-designed, fair tests, with overwhelmingly positive results. Reboxetine was better than placebo, and as good as any other antidepressant in head-to-head comparisons. It&#x2019;s approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the MHRA) in the UK, but wisely, the US FDA chose not to approve it. (This is no proof of the FDA being any smarter; there are plenty of drugs available in the US that the UK never approved.) Reboxetine was clearly a safe and and effective treatment. The patient and I discussed the evidence briefly, and agreed it was the right treatment to try next. I signed a prescription saying I wanted my patient to have this drug. <br>But we had both been misled. In October 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine.6 Through a long process of investigation &#x2013; searching in academic journals, but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators &#x2013; they were able to assemble all the data, both from trials that were published, and from those that had never appeared in academic papers. <br>When all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. But six more trials were conducted, in almost ten times as many patients. All of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. None of these trials was published. I had no idea they existed. <br>It got worse. The trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. They were all published. But 1,657 patients&#x2019; worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. If all this wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, there was also the side-effects data. The drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature: but when we saw the unpublished studies, it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects, more likely to drop out of taking the drug, and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects, if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors. <br>If you&#x2019;re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry &#x2013; and I promise you, whatever happens, I will keep to the data, and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know &#x2013; you need only look at this story. I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished. <br>If you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us. <br>In a few pages, we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt, showing that &#x2018;publication bias&#x2019; &#x2013; the process whereby negative results go unpublished &#x2013; is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia; and that regulators have failed to do anything about it, despite decades of data showing the size of the problem. But before we get to that research, I need you to feel its implications, so we need to think about why missing data matters. <br>Evidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works &#x2013; or doesn&#x2019;t work &#x2013; in medicine. We proceed by testing things, as cautiously as we can, in head-to-head trials, and gathering together <i>all</i> of the evidence. This last step is crucial: if I withhold half the data from you, it&#x2019;s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn&#x2019;t true. If I toss a coin a hundred times, for example, but only tell you about the results when it lands heads-up, I can convince you that this is a two-headed coin. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean I really do have a two-headed coin: it means I&#x2019;m misleading you, and you&#x2019;re a fool for letting me get away with it. This is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine, and always have. Researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish, and then choose which ones to publish. <br>The repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients, and way beyond trials. Medical research isn&#x2019;t an abstract academic pursuit: it&#x2019;s about people, so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real, living people to unnecessary, avoidable suffering. <br> <i>TGN1412</i> <br>In March 2006, six volunteers arrived at a London hospital to take part in a trial. It was the first time a new drug called TGN1412 had ever been given to humans, and they were paid �2,000 each.7 Within an hour these six men developed headaches, muscle aches, and a feeling of unease. Then things got worse: high temperatures, restlessness, periods of forgetting who and where they were. Soon they were shivering, flushed, their pulses racing, their blood pressure falling. Then, a cliff: one went into respiratory failure, the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid. Nobody knew why. Another dropped his blood pressure to just 65/40, stopped breathing properly, and was rushed to an intensive care unit, knocked out, intubated, mechanically ventilated. Within a day all six were disastrously unwell: fluid on their lungs, struggling to breathe, their kidneys failing, their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies, and their white blood cells disappearing. Doctors threw everything they could at them: steroids, antihistamines, immune-system receptor blockers. All six were ventilated on intensive care. They stopped producing urine; they were all put on dialysis; their blood was replaced, first slowly, then rapidly; they needed plasma, red cells, platelets. The fevers continued. One developed pneumonia. And then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries. Their fingers and toes went flushed, then brown, then black, and then began to rot and die. With heroic effort, all escaped, at least, with their lives. <br>The Department of Health convened an Expert Scientific Group to ...</p><h2>The Seychelles affair</h2><p>The "Seychelles Affair" is one of the most infamous episodes in the tangled history of mercenary warfare in Africa.

Equally fascinating is the author's description of his dealings with South African intelligence agencies, the subsequent prosecution by those who had helped them prepare for the coup, his attempts to organize a proper defense and obtain a fair trial for himself and his 30 men, and what it was like to spend 33 months in a South African prison.<br><br>In the exclusive new foreword to this Paladin reprint, Colonel Hoare sheds new light on the events leading up to the failed coup, discusses the lingering ramifications of the failure on the nation of Seychelles and relates how his conviction affected his life after he got out of prison.<br><br>Don't miss this opportunity to read Hoare's wonderfully wry and insightful account of how one little mistake can unravel even the best-laid plans.</p><p>Mike Hoare is one of the 20th century&#39;s most famous adventurers, and clearly one of its most talented scribes.

Born in Russia, he spent most of his life in France. His interpretation of Hegel and his notorious declaration that history had come to an end exerted great influence on French thinkers and writers such as Raymond Aron, Georges Bataille, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Lacan, and Raymond Queneau. An unorthodox Marxist, he was a critic of Martin Heidegger and interlocutor of Leo Strauss who played a significant role in establishing the European Economic Community; a polyglot with many unusual interests, he wrote works, mostly unpublished in his lifetime, on quantum physics, the problem of the infinite, Buddhism, atheism, and Vassily Kandinsky&#x2019;s paintings.<br><br>In <i>The Black Circle</i>, Jeff Love reinterprets Koj�ve&#x2019;s works, showing him to be an essential thinker who challenged modern society and its valuation of individuality, self-interest, and freedom from death. Emphasizing Koj�ve&#x2019;s neglected Russian roots, <i>The Black Circle</i> puts him in the context of the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Russian debates over the proper ends of human life. Love explores notions of perfection, freedom, and finality in Koj�ve&#x2019;s account of Hegel and his neglected later works, clarifying Koj�ve&#x2019;s emancipatory thinking and the meaning of the oft-misinterpreted &#x201c;end of history.&#x201d; Combining intellectual history, close textual analysis, and philosophy, <i>The Black Circle</i> reveals Koj�ve&#x2019;s thought as a profound critique of capitalist individualism and a timely meditation on human freedom.</p><p>No price on coverJeff Love is Research Professor of German and Russian at Clemson University.

Created by actress Sheila Kelley (<i>LA Law, Sisters,</i> and a host of film and Broadway roles), <i>S-Factor</i> classes are wildly popular and generating an avalanche of attention from <i>Extra, Entertainment Tonight, The Los Angeles Times, Allure, Us</i> magazine, <i>Fox News</i>, and CBS's <i>48 Hours</i>, which proclaimed: "Women don't even know they're working out until two months later when they say, 'I've never had a better body in my life. I'm strong, I'm limber, I feel great.'" Sheila even convinced Barbara Walters to try a pole dance on <i>The View</i>.<br><br>No wonder. Combining yoga, dance, and erotic movements, <i>The S Factor</i> is a program that tones muscle, firms the body, increases flexibility, promotes weight loss, and gives you a few new tricks for the bedroom. Illustrated in hundreds of photographs that show step by step how each move is done, the exercises are sensual yet demanding, requiring a balance of strength and finesse. There are slow, rounded warm-ups, the Spine Circles and Hip Circles. Strenuous motions, like the Rocking Cat-Cow. Peels and rolls, grinds, pounces, arches. And pole work, from the Firefly to Descending Angel.<br><br>Something else happens, too: These exercises and routines boost self-esteem and give women a new way to think about their bodies. Stripping is a liberating act, out of which comes a new look, new body, new confidence, new you.</p><p>A remarkable talent who brings experience and grace to all her projects, Sheila Kelley is a performer who embodies the very femininity actresses covet and strive for. Inspired by her role in Dancing at the Blue Iguana, a gritty, unapologetic story about women who make their living as strippers (which she also co-wrote and produced), Sheila discovered the natural sexual power of stripping. In April 2001 she began teaching her stripping technique in a class called the S Factor out of her home. So successful were these classes that Sheila was forced to hire more instructors and move the classes to a new, larger studio, which opened in June 2003 in Los Angeles. To spread the movement to women across the country Sheila has written The S Factor: Strip Workouts for Every Woman. With an acting career spanning television, film, and theater, Sheila made her mark on the entertainment industry. Her longest television stint was four years on NBC&#39;s L.A. Law; Sheila also had a recurring role in the network&#39;s cornerstone series, E.R. Ever busy, she conquered Broadway in 1995 in My Thing of Love at the same time playing long-lost sister Charlie Bennet for the final season of Sisters. Her long line of film credits includes Cameron Crowe&#39;s Singles, Neil Labute&#39;s Nurse Betty, and a co-starring role alongside Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney in One Fine Day. Sheila can next be seen alongside Nicholas Cage in the new Warner Brothers film Matchstick Men. Sheila Kelley lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Richard Schiff (of The West Wing) and their two children.&#34;&#34;Taking Sheila Kelley&#39;s S Factor Makes you feel like you have a secret, a realy great secret that gives you confidence in everything you do and gives you an edge that makes you feel special.&#34;</p><h2>Great Expectations (Penguin Popular Classics)</h2><p>Used.

Prince Felix Youssoupov was one of the spoiled darlings of prerevolutionary St. Petersburg society, a hedonist who stumbled from one party to another. King's popular biography makes easy, compelling reading, beginning with an account of the strange life of Gregory Rasputin, who, because of his unexplained ability to control the symptoms of the czarevitch's hemophilia, came to exert enormous influence over the czarina. Rasputin grew increasingly unpopular among the high-born in the Russian capital. Enter Prince Felix, who, in his own mind, was rising to the occasion, and, with co-conspirators, hatched an assassination scheme. The effects of the deed and Youssoupov's life after the revolution are fully explored in this book general readers of Russian history will enjoy. <i>Brad Hooper</i>King (The Last Empress, LJ 6/15/94) has written a nonacademic work whose strength lies not in shocking revelations of how Felix Youssoupov killed Rasputin. Quite the contrary, after the official version is presented in chapter 15, King reports alternate versions in chapter 16. The real strength of this book lies in its portrayal of Youssoupov living without the trappings of wealth and power of prerevolution days, facing the reality of having plotted the deed that helped bring down imperial Russia. King carefully crafts a mosaic of one of the most enigmatic men of the Russian Revolution. The author does not seem to take advantage of, or has not found much information in, the recently opened Soviet archives. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>Harry Willems, Kansas Lib.

Praying about it can change everything! <p>Today&#x2019;s challenges and pressures can make a fulfilling marriage seem like an impossible dream. Yet God delights in doing the impossible if only we would ask! Stormie Omartian shares how God has strengthened her own marriage since she began to pray for her husband concerning key areas of his life, including: </p><p>- His spiritual walk <br>- His emotions <br>- His role as a father, leader, and decision-maker <br>- His security in work and finances <br>- His health and physical protection <br>- His faith and his future </p><p>If you desire a closer relationship with your husband, you will appreciate this refreshing look at the power of prayer in marriage.</p></p><p>The trials and pressures of modern life can make the prospect of a fulfilled, meaningful marriage seem impossible. In <i>The Power of a Praying Wife</i>, popular Christian author and speaker Stormie Omartian pinpoints common marital struggles and reveals the miraculous way that disciplined prayer can alleviate heartache and sustain unity. According to Omartian, a marriage's success depends upon "laying down all claim to power in and of yourself, and relying on God's power to transform you, your husband, your circumstances, and your marriage." Omartian attributes the success of her own 25-year marriage to dedicated prayer for every area--however specific--of her husband's life; from his finances and his work to his integrity and his temptations. Each chapter offers insight into areas that are especially important to men, followed by "power tools" (inspiring, topical Scripture) to guide one's prayer life and transform a woman's mind with regard to her husband. This practical read will encourage women to trust God to change their spouse, and undoubtedly refocus one's perspective on God's power rather than one's own personal predicament. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p><b>Stormie Omartian</b> is the bestselling author of The Power of a Praying� series (more than 35 million books sold).

Little is known of her actual life: she was born into a poor family and both her parents died in a famine. Separated from her sisters, homeless and destitute, she was sold into slavery but was eventually freed. In later life she became famous as a saint; she was offered money, houses, proposals of marriage, but she preferred to remain single and live in humble surroundings. The bulk of the Rabi&#39;a material as we know it comes from stories of her interactions with those who came to challenge or learn from her. Uncompromising and singleminded in her devotion to the highest spritual realization, she belittled miracles that apparently happened around her, the fear of hell, and the desire for paradise. Sometimes even well-known spiritual figures, like Hasan of Basra, could be the butt of her sharper wit, deeper wisdom, and greater spiritual powe</p><p>Text: English, Arabic (translation)</p><h2>The Frugal Gambler</h2><p>Learn the low-roller secrets for:<br><br>Staying free at hotel-casinos<br>Beating casino promotions<br>Eating and drinking on the house<br>Playing video poker for profit<br>Getting bumped from airplanes and flying free<br><br>Though Jean Scott was well-known to a select few Las Vegas aficionados throughout the '90s, it wasn't until the publication of <i>The Frugal Gambler</i> in 1998 that she became a household name to casino players across the country.

Yet those words seem to perfectly describe <i>Joy of Cooking,</i> the indispensable cookbook that for more than eighty years has been bible and kitchen companion to renowned chefs and household cooks alike. Once again, the <i>Joy of Cooking 2014 Day-to-Day Calendar</i>--the fifteenth edition--borrows from this esteemed source and presents helpful daily kitchen and culinary hints, while its weekly undated pages provide a favorite recipe to try.</p><p>Since its first private printing in 1931, <i>The Joy of Cooking</i> has been teaching Americans how to cook. Craig Claiborne calls it "a masterpiece of clarity" and Julia Child says it's the one book she'd keep if she could only have one English title on the shelf. The nearly 5,000 recipes are handily organized by meal and ingredient, and no cooking instruction goes unexplained, so you can <i>finally</i> understand the difference between poaching and braising. The book includes nutritional information as well as an extremely helpful list of measures and equivalents. You'll find a version of every recipe your mother ever cooked, along with straightforward instructions for cooking more exotic specialties such as turtles and muskrats.Irma Rombauer self-published the first <i>Joy of Cooking</i> in 1931 with the small insurance payout she received after her husband committed suicide during the Great Depression. Suddenly, society wives who used to enjoy a kitchen staff no longer had the money to employ them and began cooking for themselves. The instruction "stand facing the stove" was a bit more pragmatic than we realize. In 1936, the first commercial edition was published by Bobbs-Merrill. Marion Rombauer Becker, Irma's daughter, joined the Joy dynasty and revised and updated each subsequent edition until 1975. That edition was the first after Irma's death and was completely Marion's.

Shepherd, craftsman, herald, musician, athlete, merchant -- who is this tricky shapechanger confronting man at every truth? In this classic, prescient work (first published in 1947, and foreshadowing all subsequent work greeting the return of the gods), Brown asks, &#34;Is Hermes the Thief the prototype, from which, by extension and analogy, the Trickster was derived? Or is the notion of trickery the fundamental one, and theft merely a specific manifestation of it?&#34;</p><p><b>Norman Oliver Brown</b> (1913&#x2013;2002) was an American intellectual of wide ranging interests, graduating from Oxford with an MA and from the University of Wisconsin in Madison with a Ph.D. in the Classics. During World War II, Brown worked for the OSS as a specialist on French culture and later became Professor of Classics at Wesleyan University. In the late 1960s, he moved on to the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he was named Professor of Humanities. His initial work in classics betrayed a Marxist bent (his commentary to <i>Hesiod&#x2019;s Theogony</i> and his first monograph, <i>Hermes the Thief</i>). Following his disenchantment with real politics in the wake of the 1948 presidential election, Brown turned to a deep study of the works of Freud, which culminated in his classic 1959 study <i>Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytic Meaning of History.</i> During his long residence at Santa Cruz, his interests broadened to include James Joyce, classical poetry and mythology, and a deep study of Islam. Many of his later writings were collected in the anthology <i>Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis.</i></p><h2>The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David</h2><p>Since the eighteenth century, scholars and historians studying the texts of the Bible have attempted to distill historical facts and biography from the mythology and miracles described there. That trend continues into the present day, as scholars such as those of the &#34;Jesus Seminar&#34; dissect the Gospels and other early Christian writings to separate the &#34;Jesus of history&#34; from the &#34;Christ of faith.&#34; But with The Messiah Myth, noted Biblical scholar Thomas L. Thompson argues that the quest for the historical Jesus is beside the point, since the Jesus of the Gospels never existed.Like King David before him, says Thompson, the Jesus of the Bible is an amalgamation of themes from Near Eastern mythology and traditions of kingship and divinity. The theme of a messiah-a divinely appointed king who restores the world to perfection-is typical of Egyptian and Babylonian royal ideology dating back to the Bronze Age. In Thompson&#39;s view, the contemporary audience for whom the Old and New Testament were written would naturally have interpreted David and Jesus not as historical figures, but as metaphors embodying long-established messianic traditions. Challenging widely held assumptions about the sources of the Bible and the quest for the historical Jesus, The Messiah Myth is sure to spark interest and heated debate.</p><p><b>Thomas L. Thompson</b> is one of the leading biblical archaeologists in the world. He was awarded a National Endowment fellowship, has taught at Lawrence and Marquette Universities in Wisconsin, and currently teaches at the University of Copenhagen, which has one of the most prestigious Biblical Studies programs in the world. His book, <i>The Early History of the Israelite People,</i> a famously controversial book at the time, is now a standard text in the field. He lives in Denmark.Were David and Jesus fictional or historical figures? Do their stories actually report history, or are they simply tales that use familiar mythic elements about heroic figures to turn David and Jesus into heroes for a new generation? Thompson, who challenged conventional understandings of the history of Israel in <i>The Mythic Past</i>, answers these and other questions in this provocative but often pedantic study. Drawing on the wealth of tales of kings and saviors in Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek and Roman literature, he demonstrates that the biblical stories of David's military successes and Jesus' moral teaching are simply fictions weaving these earlier traditions into new hero stories. In addition, he reveals that the story of Jesus' resurrection was fashioned almost exclusively from the story of the dying and rising god, Dionysus. For Thompson, Jesus and David emerge merely as characters in stories that reveal the value of the good king. Although Thompson provides a valuable service by situating the Jesus and David tales in the context of other ancient Near Eastern literature, his argument that the biblical writers used such literature to write their fictions of David and Jesus is neither new nor startling. In addition, the lack of a coherent structure and a definitive conclusion lessens the effectiveness of Thompson's book. <i>(Apr. 12)</i></p><h2>Make It Easy: 120 Mix-and-Match Recipes to Cook from Scratch -- with Smart Store-Bought Shortcuts When You Need Them</h2><p>Cooking doesn't have to be a chore.

The kids listen idly to rockabilly on the radio and waste their weekends at the Dairy Queen. And an undetected menace simmers under the heat that clings to the skin like molasses... For thirteen-year-old Stanley Mitchell, the end of innocence comes with his discovery of the mysterious long-ago demise of two very different young women. In his quest to unravel the truth about their tragic fates, Stanley finds a protector in Buster Lighthorse Smith, a black, retired Indian-reservation cop and a sage on the finer points of Sherlock Holmes, the blues, and life&#39;s faded dreams. But not every buried thing stays dead. And on one terrifying night of rushing creek water and thundering rain, an arcane, murderous force will rise from the past to threaten the boy in a harrowing rite of passage... Vintage Lansdale, A Fine Dark Line brims with exquisite suspense, powerful characterizations, and the vibrant evocation of a lost time.</p><p>Joe R. Lansdale lives in Nacogdoches, Texas.If Mark Twain had written To Kill a Mockingbird or Summer of '42, it might sound something like Dick Hill's reading of A Fine Dark Line. Hill has the ear, the pitch, and the understanding to tell the story of 13-year-old Stanley Mitchell's all too fast coming-of-age in precisely the way author Joe Lansdale intended. In fact, Hill is the perfect match for Lansdale, who is no slouch when it comes to the oral storytelling tradition. Living in Dewmont, Texas, in 1958, where his parents own a drive-in theater, Stanley is completely ignorant of issues of sex, race, poverty, and violence. When he discovers a box of old love letters and journal entries near the ruins of a long-ago house fire, he unwittingly uncovers a forgotten scandal and several murders. S.E.S.

Dan Sickles, formerly a Tammany Hall politician of tarnished reputation and lately the commander of the Third Corps, had occupied the house as his headquarters through the latter half of that winter, but on the cold and lowery afternoon of March 12 he surrendered the grounds to a wedding reception for one of his junior officers. The groom had been unable to secure a furlough to be married, so the ceremony transpired in the camp of the 7th New Jersey, in which the groom commanded a company. Besides the betrothed captain, who hovered within a few days of his twenty-fourth birthday, the wedding party consisted of a bride not yet nineteen and nine adventurous bridesmaids, who had accompanied her on the steamer from Washington City. Chief among the guests stood Major General Joseph Hooker, who for the past forty-five days had commanded the Army of the Potomac. The entire regiment turned out under arms to form a hollow square around them all. <br>&nbsp;The second week of March had alternated between luscious spring sun and soggy reminders of winter - but, unfortunately for the ladies in their light gowns, March 12 fell on the chillier side of that cycle. Raw winds reddened bare arms and chests, while foreboding Virginia skies demanded a canvas canopy to protect the nuptials. The New Jersey chaplain officiated while Daniel Hart and Ellen Lammond knelt before an altar of stacked snare drums to pledge themselves to each other, and when they arose as husband and wife the brigade band announced it with a blaring processional. Ladies, generals, band, and all then adjourned for a banquet and ball under tents raised in the yard of the Fitzhugh farm, where they prolonged the festivities into the evening. The brassy echo carried far across the hills of Stafford County, serenading thousands of envious soldiers sprawled in their camps above Fredericksburg. <br>&nbsp;Weddings naturally prompt reflections on the future, but any such thoughts on this occasion could only have dampened the festive atmosphere. The shock of a bloody and lopsided defeat at Fredericksburg, only three months past, had not been forgotten. Just seven weeks before the wedding, a disastrous flank march had sent the dejected army into winter quarters, from which, inevitably, it would soon emerge for another attempt to subdue Robert E. Lee, his Army of Northern Virginia, and the rebellious states of the Southern Confederacy. Another seven weeks would find many of the participants dead, or seriously wounded. Captain Hart would be among the latter, and although he would survive his wounds he would never find successful employment outside the army; by cleaving to him, Nelly Lammond consigned herself to a dozen years on the barren plains of West Texas, sixteen years of widow's weeds, and an early grave. <br>&nbsp;The celebrants therefore dwelt upon the present. Starved as they had been for distaff company, most of the soldiers doubtless found the present agreeable enough, with the bride's retinue to brighten the affair, and few men in that army appreciated female companionship more than Dan Sickles and Joe Hooker. So appealing were the bridesmaids to Sickles that he persuaded them to stay on another day - inviting them, the newlyweds, Hooker, and a host of Third Corps generals, colonels, and staff officers back to the Fitzhugh farm the next night to celebrate his recent promotion to major general. Detailed soldiers and servants festooned the yard with evergreen boughs and flags, and when the guests arrived that evening, Friday the 13th, the tents all glowed with the glitter of hundreds of candles. Even a couple of somberly clad chaplains sipped some wine and partook of the feast, though they stood aside for the dancing and departed before midnight. <br>&nbsp;It was perhaps such contrived gaiety, more than the frequently dismal weather, that led one Yankee artilleryman to remark a few days later that their winter along the Rappahannock had been &#x201c;uncommon pleasant,&#x201d; and the men wearing shoulder straps let no excuse for merriment pass. Saint Patrick's Day provided an opportunity for epic revelry, and as one might have expected, the Irish Brigade greeted it in that spirit. Outside their camp above Falmouth, enlisted men wielded shovels that their officers might play. On relatively flat ground they cleared a racetrack a mile long, complete with hurdles and ditches as wide as ten feet. Thomas Meagher, the hard-drinking brigadier, appeared in knee breeches, a cutaway coat, and a white stovepipe hat, reminding his troops of a circus ringmaster. He further cultivated that image by barking for donations to fund the frolic, although the facilities had all been produced by the labor of government soldiers. &#x201c;Here is a large capacity,&#x201d; he apprised his assembled subordinates and superiors, holding the stovepipe hat upside down; &#x201c;now fill it.&#x201d; The donations afforded graduated prizes for the three fleetest horses and riders, but much of that ended up in Meagher's pocket anyway: it was Meagher's Irish adjutant, dressed in bright jockey attire and astride the general's own little grey mare, who took first prize in the steeplechase after three heats. Following the main event Meagher opened the track to anyone else who wanted to ride, at a fee of five dollars dropped in his cavernous hat. That afternoon the reverberations of a heavy skirmish at Kelly's Ford, miles upstream, interrupted the entertainment in the middle of a sack race. &#x201c;Get out of those bags,&#x201d; Meagher bellowed at the participants, and the brigade fell in to join the fray, but the alarm subsided before the first man stepped off. <br>&nbsp;David Birney, commander of a division in the Third Corps under Sickles, refused to be outdone by the loudmouthed immigrant Meagher, and he scheduled his own festival for March 26, to celebrate nothing in particular. The same sports prevailed: horse racing, with and without hurdles; a greased pole; sack races; and &#x201c;buckfights,&#x201d; in which men bound in a squatting position tried to knock each other over. General Hooker attended this gathering as he had all the others, and with him came the usual assortment of women. The bridesmaids had all returned to Washington, but scores of officers had brought their wives and daughters down to board at houses around the countryside, or to live with them in tents or stockaded huts, and that population obligingly submitted to corsets and crinoline. Garnering the most attention were the wives of two New York colonels. Both women inspired abundant occupation for the eyes and tongues of the troops, but it was the one who called herself Princess Salm- Salm whom everyone remembered. Formerly an actress under the name Agnes Leclerq, she had recently married Colonel Felix Prince Salm, a Prussian soldier of fortune who had come to America for this war. Princess Salm-Salm insinuated that she had seen only twenty-one winters, but an artillery officer who observed her that afternoon remarked that she and the other colonel's wife &#x201c;have been very handsome women in their day.&#x201d; He considered them &#x201c;still good-looking enough to stand very well in the eyes of General Joe,&#x201d; but Joe Hooker was nearing the end of his fifth decade. The day closed badly for the erstwhile Miss Leclerq: horses and riders showed less grace, with many a mount balking at the hurdles and numerous horsemen taking dangerous tumbles. Colonel Salm fell so hard that witnesses at first deemed his injuries mortal, but General Sickles gallantly consoled the princess while the surgeons saved her prince for death on another field. <br>&nbsp;That near tragedy may have diluted enthusiasm for further orchestrations. Colonels were paid too well to have them lying about for months, recuperating from foolish accidents while lesser field officers oversaw their regiments. The Potomac army was growing short of officers that winter in any case, as many of those who had escaped the slaughter at Fredericksburg exercised the privilege of resigning their commissions, but the popularity of that avenue was not confined to the eastern theater. Lieutenants and captains from Maine to the Mississippi made their excuses as the spring campaigns drew nigh, or they dragged out convalescent furloughs for nebulous varieties of indisposition. &#x201c;I don't believe the 'young patriots' will ever come back,&#x201d; said a Regular Army captain of some freshly appointed lieutenants on sick leave, &#x201c;as they didn't come into the service except to draw their pay.&#x201d; Some enlisted men who had just obtained commissions soon surrendered them for a discharge, and some applied for commissions precisely so they might exercise that very privilege. One of the senior captains in a Maine regiment found it difficult to resign because his services were deemed so crucial, and when ordered to rejoin his regiment he sought a presidential appointment as quartermaster so he could &#x201c;get a Com[mission] to resign.&#x201d; Large numbers of men in the ranks had also decamped on the sly, choosing more informal and risky means of separation by overstaying their furloughs, disappearing into the army's byzantine medical system, or simply walking away from camp in a suit of civilian clothing. Sympathetic relatives filled the express trains with boxes of such clothing to help their soldier boys desert. <br>&nbsp;One Connecticut colonel tried repeatedly during the winter to recover men who had slipped away from his command, but sometimes he gave up on them. After months of chasing several furloughed convalescents, he dropped them from the rolls of the regiment only to hear, soon afterward, that some of them had inveigled a surgeon into awarding them certificates of disability for their sundry ailments. The colonel ruled those tardy documents invalid, and declared the men deserters. Another private who appeared to enjoy good health left camp without permission and headed home, where he visited around enough that reports leaked back to regimental headquarters. He, too, attempted to absolve himself on a belated plea of illness, but the frustrated colonel would hear none of that, either. <br>&nbsp;William Greene, of the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters, typified this more casual deserter. After nearly a year of service, during which he had indignantly castigated those who failed to answer their country's call, Greene seemed to experience a conversion that became apparent late in the summer of 1862, when his regiment wandered into its first major battle at Second Bull Run. The sharpshooters fled the field and abandoned the battery they were supposed to support. Greene left the ranks soon thereafter because, as he explained it, he &#x201c;got tired out,&#x201d; but that fatigue did not prevent him from walking all the way to Alexandria, where he sought a hospital bed. The surgeons sent him north to a hospital in Rhode Island. He schemed persistently for a discharge without success, but finally he left the hospital on a furlough and neglected to return. First he went home to southern New Hampshire, but over the winter he migrated to south-central Wisconsin. His sister and brother-in-law had moved out there to start a farm, and late in March he began working for them at $14.50 a month, plus keep. His infrequent letters bore no signatures, lest a prying postmaster report his whereabouts; it may have been fear of discovery that eventually prompted him to leave his sister's house and start drifting. <br>&nbsp;A private in a new regiment from central New York appealed for a furlough, but his request was not among the few that his colonel granted, so he circulated the news that his mother was dying, or had died, and one of his comrades gave up his own furlough so the bereaved private might attend the funeral. No good turn goes unpunished, the generous comrade found, and late in March he remarked that the beneficiary of the sacrificed furlough &#x201c;got on the wrong train&#x201d; for the return trip, grumbling that &#x201c;it took him to Canada instead of Washington.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;Soon after the glorified skirmish that served as his maiden battle, a Massachusetts shoemaker named Andrew Grover had inexplicably gotten himself captured in a locale completely dominated by the Union army. In July of 1862, as soon as the opposing forces agreed on a system of prisoner exchanges, Grover was released from Southern custody under the customary parole precluding him from bearing arms against the Confederacy until a rebel soldier of equal rank had been freed in formal exchange. He took that as license to return North, and like many former prisoners he simply stayed there, dodging the government's haphazard pursuit of such truants. In the spring of 1863 he was making his way northward from Massachusetts, supporting himself by selling bootleg liquor. He had just crossed the New Hampshire border into Fryeburg, Maine, when he ran into trouble, for Maine was a dry state and some abstemious resident turned him in. A transient miscreant of military age bore some investigation, with thousands of deserters roaming the country, and by the time the grand jury indicted Grover on liquor charges, his secret had been found out: at his court appearance an army officer took charge of him. <br>&nbsp;Some men seemed to disappear into thin air. The previous autumn Francis Richards had straggled behind the 11th New Hampshire during the march across northern Virginia, and when he failed to answer the roll call that evening, everyone supposed he had been scooped up by Confederate cavalry. Then the wife of one of his neighbors saw Richards at home and wrote about it to her husband, who served in the same company. The husband expressed considerable surprise that his comrade had deserted, but he revealed nothing like disapproval: he merely assured his wife that he would never abscond without consulting her first. By March of 1863, he added, desertion from camp had become almost impossible, so vigilantly did the perimeter guards and the provost details monitor the peregrinations of solitary soldiers. <br>&nbsp;None of these men endured more than a taste of the battlefield: they may have forsaken their commitments over personal or political epiphanies inspired by a few months of service in the field. For thousands of other soldiers who had borne the brunt of the fighting, it was perhaps the sheer brutality of the conflict that had impelled them on clandestine journeys homeward, and especially from the Army of the Potomac, where stunning carnage seemed to produce the least tangible results. The previous December, waves of blue infantry had swept up Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg against raking Confederate artillery and a well-protected tier of blazing rifles, all without the slightest effect beyond depleting Southern ammunition. On the plain below Fredericksburg, William B. Franklin had sent out a feeble assault that nevertheless managed to crack Stonewall Jackson's line, but Franklin failed to support that breakthrough sufficiently and it was driven back with heavy losses. Well over a thousand Union soldiers had been killed on the field that bleak day, and the death toll neared three thousand after the worst-wounded had succumbed, but all those lives had not bought an inch of ground. Ambrose Burnside finally withdrew everyone to the left bank of the Rappahannock, and six weeks later, after deep mud doomed his last ...</p></p><h2>WW III</h2><p>In the Pacific--Off Koreans east cost, 185 miles south of the DMZ, six Russian-made TU-22M backfires come in low, carrying two seven-hundred-pound cluster bombs, three one-thousand-pound "iron" bombs, ten one-thousand-pound concrete-piercing bombs, and fifty-two-hundred-pound FAEs.<br>In Europe--Twenty Soviet Warsaw Pact infantry divisions and four thousand tanks begin to move.

This is a book about origins (not least, the origins of words) and oracles: the places where things start from, the ground of understanding -- whether in Arcadia or Anahorish, the sanctuary at Epidaurus or the Bann valley in County Derry.</p><p><i>Electric Light</i> ranges from short takes to conversation poems. The pre-Socratic wisdom that everything flows is held in tension with the elegizing of friends and fellow poets. These gifts of recollection renew the poet's calling to assign things their proper names; once again Heaney can be heard exting his word hoard and roll call in this, his eleventh collection.</p></p><p>Seamus Heaney's 11th collection of poems, <i>Electric Light</i>, continues his excavation of childhood, his vivifying love of nature, and his quest into the meaning of poetry itself in an utterly pleasurable and satisfying way. As the poet squares up to his own mortality, many of the poems are dedicated to the memory of lost friends and poets like Joseph Brodsky. Yet the urgency and optimism of new birth is a lively presence in the book too. "Bann Valley Eclogue," for example, prophesizes a time when "old markings / Will avail no more to keep east bank from west. / The valley will be washed like the new baby." And in "Out of the Bag," the child narrator believes that newborns emerge from the doctor's bag--or, in one hallucinatory moment, from the washbasin: "The baby bits all come together swimming / Into his soapy big hygienic hands." <p> Childhood is an unfading, unfailing element in Heaney's work, and is caught with a breathless vitality. "The Real Names" revisits the schoolboys who played Shakespeare: Owen Kelly as "Sperrins Caliban" with "turnip fists," and "Catatonic Bobby X" as Feste, "with his curled-in shoulders and cabbage-water eyes / speechlessly rocking." Here is the humor, exactness, scope, and tenderness of Heaney at his best. His language is as muscular and inventive as ever. Idiom meets innovation in compounds like <i>rut-shuddery</i> and <i>flood-slubs</i>--and <i>waver</i> is neatly subverted into a noun in "Perch." Throughout <i>Electric Light</i>, Heaney demonstrates exactly how poetry can capture the "flows and steady go of the world." <i>--Cherry Smyth</i></p><b>Seamus Heaney</b> (1939-2013) received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995. His poems, plays, translations, and essays include <i>Opened Ground</i>, <i>Electric Light</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>, <i>The Spirit Level</i>, <i>District and Circle</i>, and <i>Finders Keepers</i>. Robert Lowell praised Heaney as the "most important Irish poet since Yeats."</p><h2>The Secret Garden (Ladybird Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Published in 1980 by Ladybird Books of England, this is a retelling of the great classic story.

In this collection of essays, twelve priests (including four bishops) reflect on the spirituality of the diocesan priest from their personal and pastoral experience.Have diocesan priests finally transcended the monastic and religious order spiritualities that have shaped their prayer and interior lives for centuries? Is a spirituality particular to the diocesan priest emerging precisely at a time when the priesthood is under such close scrutiny? The contributors - pastors, theologians, poets, and bishops - grapple with the maturing of the diocesan priest&#39;s soul, touch the mystery of the priesthood, and unveil personal, often moving, dramas of grace.Contributors and their articles include Tenders of the Word&#34; by Donald B.

His fiction received attention in the late punk seventies with<i> The DNA Cowboys</i> cult trilogy. Through the 1980s and 1990s, he tempered cyberpunk with his own post-Burroughs, post-Lovecraft strangeness, while, at the same time functioning as a columnist, critic, recording artist, teaching a science fiction and horror course at UCLA, publishing a number of non-fiction works on popular culture, including a best selling biography of Elvis Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, and the bizarre-fashion history T<i>he Black Leather</i>, and also providing Rock &amp; Roll lyrics for bands like Metallica, Motorhead, Brother Wayne Kramer, and others. With Kramer, he created the off-Broadway musical <i>The Last Words Of Dutch Schultz</i>, and he has scripted a number of TV documentaries. He emerged into the 21st century with the critically acclaimed and suitably unorthodox vampire saga<i> The Renquist Quartet</i>, and the forthcoming alternate world epic<i> Flame Of Evil</i>.<br><br>Farren currently lives in Los Angeles. His most recent non-fiction is the autobiographic <i>Give The Anarchist A Cigarette</i> (Jonathan Cape, UK), his most recent novel is <i>Underland</i> (Tor Books US), and his current CDs are People Call You Crazy: The Mick Farren Story (Sanctuary UK) and The Deviants Dr Crow (Navarre US).<br>First vampire novel by sf writer Farren (Elvis and the Colonel, 1989, not reviewed) swaggers swankily and advances the genre by creating a new version of vampires' ancestry: Their creators came in UFOs, altered human DNA to fashion the new creatures, and, in their spare time, provided the inspiration for humankind's religions. Suave, thousand-year-old Victor Renquist, the Master of the nosferatu, who live in the Residence in Manhattan, must constantly temper the bloodlust of his followers, compelling them to restrict themselves to hospital bloodbags rather than living human prey. Victor is well aware that the colony risks extermination if it goes on a wilding and leaves exsanguinated bodies all over the city; after all, when European vampire families got out of hand in 1919, they were exterminated by the Church. Victor, who has sought to protect the colony by moving in the circles of the powerful and chic, has not left the Residence for two years, having become too famous for comfort. He's appeared in People magazine and on TV, has hosted parties for Henry Kissinger, Joan Collins, Edward Kennedy, Ivan Boesky, and even Mick Jagger. He is attended by a vampire Sicilian enforcer, Lupo, who calls Renquist Don Victor and treats him as Godfather. Also on hand is wildly intemperate young Carfax, who rebels against Victor's edict on bloodletting and plots to set up his own family. To complicate matters further, the time of ritual feasting, when the colony must replenish its energies by seeking live prey, is near. Wily Victor speculates that the feasting, if properly disguised, might be seen as the work of serial killers and psychopaths--if he can just keep his impetuous fellow vampires in line. Meanwhile, he is being pursued by Gideon Kelly, a defrocked whiskey priest on a vampire-hunting mission from God, and by a tough Manhattan police detective. The historical background offers considerable originality, while the storytelling speeds along with theatrical trumpery through predictable plot points. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Burma is culturally rich and complex in many ways, but perhaps nowhere more than in its extraordinary food culture. It's at the crossroads between the food of the great Indian subcontinent (to its west) and the food of Southeast Asia (to its east), with a dash of Chinese influence (from the north), making it an amazing place in-between. With simple recipes for food that manages to be elegant and earthy at the same time, plus stories of a place and a people that inspired Rudyard Kipling, Somerset Maugham, and George Orwell, this may be Duguid's most enchanting cookbook yet. The book features photographs throughout--of the finished dishes, of people, of a hauntingly beautiful land--as well as travel tips, a history of Burma, extensive glossaries, and a bibliography.</p></p><p><p><b> Author Interview with Naomi Duguid</b></p> <p><strong>Why did you title the book <em>Burma</em> rather than <em>Myanmar</em>?</strong></p> <p>"Myanma" was historically used only for the small central area where the dominant Bamar population lived. It's a name that excludes the huge outlying areas where the Shan, Kachin, Karen, Chin and other peoples are the majority. In 1989, the government--then a repressive military regime--decreed that the country's official name would change from Burma to Myanmar since "Burma" was seen as a relic of colonial times. Now that political climate has relaxed, you hear people using both terms, but for more than two decades, people were punished for saying "Burma" instead of "Myanmar."</p> <p><strong>What are the staple ingredients of Burmese cooking?</strong></p> <p>The flavor staples are shallots, turmeric, limes and freshly squeezed lime juice, roasted chopped peanuts, fresh greens, chiles (though not in punchy, hot quantities usually), fish sauce, shrimp paste, shallot oil, chile oil, fresh herbs, and more. The staple foods are rice and noodles, vegetables, fish, and chicken or meat.</p> <p><strong>How does Burma's cuisine reflect its culture, its patterns of daily life?</strong></p> <p>Sharing borders with China, India, Thailand, and Bangladesh, Burma has been an Asian crossroads--and a place of fascinating layers of food culture--for centuries. The main meal of the day, served at noon, centers around rice. It always includes salads and curries served family-style and shared. This way of eating lunch sums up a lot about Burma. People eat together and share food. There's no rigid order of courses or dishes; and you can adjust the flavors of what you are eating by dabbing on a chile sauce or squeezing on a little lime juice. In other words, there's conviviality, generosity, and flexibility. And now that the political situation in Burma is improving, the inherent good-humored joking and intense discussions that people thrive on are once more happening in tea shops and out in the street, rather than behind closed doors.</p> <p><strong>What is a typical day of eating in Burma?</strong></p> <p>Breakfast and snack options are wonderfully enticing, most of them available in tea shops or at street stalls. They include a flatbread with savory cooked beans on top; the national noodle dish <em>mohinga</em>, rice noodles in a light fish broth with crispy toppings and a wide range of condiments; other noodle dishes, with rice noodles or egg noodles, and a topping of some meat and herbs; and simple rice, lightly fried with peas and topped with a little meat or vegetables.</p> <p>Lunch is the main meal. Each person has a plate of plain rice and a small bowl of soup, and then shares in the array of other dishes on the table. There is meat and/or chicken curry, a fish curry or small fried fish, a vegetable curry, a salad or two--Burmese salads are inventive and loaded with flavors and textures--and several spicy pungent condiments, as well as a plate of raw vegetables and another of steamed vegetables, which serve as a kind of non-spicy break from the bigger flavors of the curry. The meal finishes with a little fruit or some palm sugar.</p> <p>Sweets are eaten as snacks in the afternoon or evening rather than as "desserts" at the end of a meal. In the evening, people eat noodle dishes or a light meal of rice, soup, salad, and chile sauce. At any hour, they can seek out street foods of all kinds, including savory crepes or deep-fried snacks.</p> <p><strong>The country has many ethnic groups and thus many cuisines; what are the main ones--and are there any common factors?</strong></p> <p>Salads are one of the glories of the cuisine no matter where you are in Burma. They're flavored with fried shallots, roasted peanuts, lime juice, and more. Noodle dishes, often served with a broth and a wonderful array of condiments, are another common thread. In all the food there's a subtle dance and balance between tart, salty, and sweet, with a touch of chile heat. (More chiles are used on the West coast, but they're generally on the table as an optional condiment rather than as a dominant fiery taste in cooked dishes.)</p> <p>Central Burmese cuisine, also referred to as Bamar, has a lighter touch than central Thai--less sweet, less chile heat, more fresh vegetables on the table. For the main meal of the day, there are a whole set of small dishes on the table: a vegetable curry, a meat curry, a fish curry, a salad, and several condiments, as well as plain steamed and raw vegetables. Shan cuisine employs salt rather than fish sauce, lots of fresh herbs, vegetables cooked with meat in succulent curries, inventive noodle dishes, and salads flavored with toasted sesame seeds along with lime juice and sliced shallots. Kachin cuisine, from the far north, is light, includes lots of fresh herbs, and subtly balanced flavors in both the meat and the vegetable curries.</p> <p><strong>What is the dish from <em>Burma</em> that anyone and everyone must rush home and make tonight?</strong></p> <p>The Lemongrass Sliders (p. 192) are a great and easy introduction to the possibilities in the book, and so are many of the salads. The Ginger Salad (p. 48) is one of my favorites. For those who like chile heat, my favorite condiment, Tart-Sweet-Chile-Garlic Sauce (p. 36), is another good place to start.</p> <p><strong>You've been traveling in Burma since 1980; what changes have you observed?</strong></p> <p>In the eighties Burma was a country that had been closed off from the rest of the world. There was an old-world charm to that, but also a lot of suffering and poverty.</p> <p>Then came the military crackdown of 1988 and more than twenty years of real fear and oppression. That was the vibe when I started work on this book in early 2009. Though people might have a sense of fun and ease in the privacy of their own homes, they were cautious and serious out on the streets and wary of being seen talking to a foreigner.</p> <p>Now that has changed, in a dramatic and wonderful way, and very quickly. Late in 2011, with reforms and a relaxation of censorship from the top, people lost their fear. They suddenly became confident that Burma was truly emerging from the black hole of oppression. Now there is laughter and open discussion in tea shops and on the streets.</p> <p>In researching and writing the book, I wanted to celebrate the richness of the food cultures of Burma and the vibrancy of individuals. I decided that there was no room for the army in the kitchen, so I put all the history of bad times at the back of the book.</p> <p>I've seen the start of a dramatic long-overdue transformation over the last year. But there are still huge issues in Burma: attacks by the army on the people of Kachin State (a place rich in resources that shares a long border with China); unresolved conflicts in many border areas; and real questions about who is going to benefit from the exploitation of the country's natural resources.</p> <p>The world has realized Burma's geopolitical importance, especially givens its rich oil and gas reserves. No wonder foreign companies and governments now want access. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been calling for a freshly negotiated political agreement among all the ethnic communities, including the majority Bamar people, and she is also asking that investors focus on building capacity in Burma, from education to roads and services. She's right on. Let's hope the world listens.</p> <p><strong>What do you wish more people knew about Burma?</strong></p> <p>At the very least, I hope the book encourages people to learn where it is. Its critical keystone location between India and China and Thailand means Burma will be a big player in Asia. And I'm hoping the book helps people learn about the country's different cultures. The Bamar are the majority people, but a quarter of the country is non-Bamar, made of a number of distinctive cultures. I use food as the medium for explaining them, and so, for example, the Shan and Kachin recipes are a delicious introduction to those cultures.</p> <p><strong>Your book is studded with stories of individuals that shed light on daily life in Burma. How did you meet and cook with people without speaking their language?</strong></p> <p>The language of food and markets is a language of gesture. Because it was important until the recent reforms to give people time to get used to me, I would go to smaller places and hang around, sipping a tea in tea shops, pedaling around on an old bicycle, taking photos of shallots and fish and anything else that caught my eye in the amazing markets. And gradually, after several days in a place, I would become a familiar sight so that people would start to connect with me, open up a little.</p> <p>The wonderful thing about a place like Burma, where food is made in the street and kitchens are often open air, is that there are endless opportunities to watch and learn as people cook, and to taste and eat at all hours. There are a remarkable number of older people who speak beautiful English, and many young people are eager to practice their English, once they feel relaxed enough to approach a foreigner. I also found that small guesthouses were places where I could safely ask questions about foods I'd encountered.</p> <p><strong>Where in Burma would you send people who want to explore its food?</strong></p> <p>Rangoon/Yangon has lively markets with foods from all the regions of Burma so it's a great place to start sampling the country's rich culinary traditions. But I think that food in smaller centers is that much closer to home cooking. So I'd send you to Bagan to see the ruins and to eat lunch under the tree in Old Bagan. I'd send you to Inle Lake to eat Shan food at the market in Nyaungshwe and to visit the villages and floating markets on the lake and to check out a couple of wineries. And farther afield, there's sleepy, beautiful Mrauk U in the far northwest, a great place to get a taste of village life and to explore the ruins of a bygone age. If you have more time, then Hpa'an and Mawlamyine on the Salween River are fascinating places, with spectacular Buddhist temples in lovely settings.</p>NAOMI DUGUID is a photographer, writer, world traveler, and great cook.

The wind had been gusting from the south at Grafton when the blizzard stormed into the area at eight o&#39;clock Saturday night. The Walsh County Record described its arrival: &#39;The wind switched from the south to the north in the time it could take to throw a switch. Snow and dust, lashed by the thundering wind that resembled a tornado in its intensity, choked to death many victims or caused them to drop exhausted, far from their intended paths, and there to slowly freeze to death as the snow swept in a grave-like sound over their bodies.&#39;&#34; (From the book&#39;s back cover)</p><p></p><h2>Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese Americans</h2><p>It was 1943. In Yosemite National Park, the magnificent Ahwahnee Hotel closed its doors to tourists, transformed into a temporary Naval convalescent hospital. Wartime shortages forced the rationing of gasoline, sugar, and film. Living with his wife, Virginia Best Adams and their children in Yosemite Valley, Ansel Adams, sought ways to help with the war effort. Too old to enlist, he volunteered for a number of assignments in which his photographic skills were put to the country's use. Among his contributions, he both escorted and photographed Army troops at Yosemite training for mountain warfare in Europe; he taught photography to the Signal Corps at Fort Ord, and traveled to the Presidio in San Francisco to print classified photographs of Japanese military installations on the Aleutian Islands. Despite his volunteer efforts, he was frustrated that he could not do more to help the war effort.<p>That summer, friend Ralph Merritt asked Adams if he would be interested in creating a photographic record of a little-known government facility in the Owens Valley, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada. "I cannot pay you a cent," Merritt told Adams, "but I can put you up and feed you." Merritt was director of the Manzanar War Relocation Center, a collection of hundreds of tar-paper barracks hastily built to house more than 10,000 people, behind barbed wire and gun towers. All were of Japanese Ancestry, but most were American citizens, forcibly removed from their homes to ten relocation centers across the country by presidential order. The resulting effort was the book <i>Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese Americans</i> published by U.S. Camera in 1944 under the direction of the War Relocation Authority. </p><p>While at Manzanar, Adams met Toyo Miyatake, the official camp photographer, interned with his wife and children. A student of the great photographer, Edward Weston, Miyatake had established his own respected professional photography studio in Los Angeles before the war. In the introduction to this book, Miyatake�s son, Archie, who was then 16-years old, recalls the visit made so long ago.</p><p> In 1965, Adams wrote in a letter to Dr. Edgar Brietenbach at the Library of Congress: " . . . I think this Manzanar Collection is an important historical document and I trust it can be put to good use. . . " In the autumn of 2000, before the Manzanar photographs of Ansel Adams were available digitally and only available as 8x10 photographic reproductions, editor Wynne Benti spent two weeks in the collections of the Library of Congress and NARA, locating many, but not all of the photographs that appeared in the original book. The book went to press as two jets crashed into the World Trade Center, thus the addition of the American flag behind the cover photograph of Joyce Nakamura Okazaki. Spotted Dog Press republished Adams' work, Born Free and Equal, introducing it to new generations of Americans.</p></p><p>On February 19, 1942, U.S. presidential order forcibly removed more than 110,000 persons from their homes to one of ten "war relocation centers" across the country. All were of Japanese ancestry, but two-thirds were American citizens. Ralph Merritt, then director of Manzanar War Relocation Center, asked friend Ansel Adams to photograph the center, set against the remote mountains of California's Sierra Nevada.<p> The resulting effort, <b>Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese Americans,</b> written and photographed by Adams, was released in 1944 to the American public as a book and exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Reeling from the impact of the bombing of Pearl Harbor and unable to make the distinction between American citizens of Japanese ancestry and the Japanese enemy of war, Adams' message was essentially lost on the American public.</p><p> In 1965, Adams donated his entire collection of Manzanar photographs to the Library of Congress. Archie Miyatake, interned at Manzanar with his family and father, Los Angeles photographer Toyo Miyatake, wrote the introduction to this new edition. His father smuggled into camp a contraband camera lens and ground glass, making a camera from scraps of wood. Toyo said to his son: "As a photographer I have a responsibility to record life here at this camp so this kind of thing never happens again."</p><p> The Institute for Learning Technologies, Teachers College/Columbia University granted Spotted Dog Press permission to link to their site where you can read a review written in 1946 by Museum of Modern Art/New York curator Nancy Newhall detailing the difficulties that Ansel Adams had trying to exhibit his BORN FREE AND EQUAL photographs</p>During the winter of 1944-45, while visiting downtown Chicago, I stopped by a newsstand to take a look at the magazines. Despite the paper shortages of war time many were still being published. A red paperback book caught my attention: Born Free and Equal, a photographic essay by Ansel Adams. I immediately reached into my purse for two dollars and bought a couple of copies. It was so exciting. Our story was finally being told, by a celebrated photographer no less. Through the photographs of Ansel Adams more Americans would learn about the internment.<p> When I returned to the newsstand a few days later, the books were gone. I thought, �How great--all sold out.� Later, a rumor circulated. The books hadn�t sold at all. They were pulled from the shelves by the federal agency that had approved the book for publication in the first place. That rumor persisted for many years, but was never substantiated. I loaned out my own copies of the book to different people over the years, until eventually, I lost track of them . . . </p><p> . . . Though Manzanar was a relatively small event in the context of the worldwide conflict that engulfed the lives of millions of people, in the continuing pursuit of �a more perfect Union. . . � it was an event of everlasting magnitude. . . </p><p> Ansel Adams went to Manzanar with the intention of contributing to the war effort . . . He hoped to tell the story of how the United States Constitution failed one group of Americans and immigrants, and to promote his belief that these people were born free and equal.<br><i>Sue Kunitomi Embrey, Chair Emeritus, Manzanar Committee (read more of Sue Embrey's story in Born Free and Equal</i></p></p><h2>Julian of Norwich: A Contemplative Biography</h2><p><p>In 1373, a thirty-year-old woman named Julian, living in East Anglia, England, began receiving visions--what she later called "sixteen showings"--that revealed to her the reality of the love of God. When she wrote these down, they became the first English-language book ever written by a woman. In this groundbreaking biograohy, AMy Frykholm recreates Julian's world and paints a vivid picture of a remarkable woman's place in it. </p></p><p><p> </p><p><b>Amy Frykholm</b> is author of <i>Rapture Culture: Left Behind in Evangelical America</i> and Special Correspondent for <i>The&nbsp;Christian Century</i>. She has received grants from the Louisville Institute, the Fulbright Scholar Program, and the Woodrow Wilson foundation for her work. She lives in Colorado.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Though she is one of the most influential figures in the history of medieval spirituality, remarkably little is known about mystic and writer Julian of Norwich - even her very name and whether she was a laywoman or a nun are uncertain. The author (Rapture Culture) attempts to supplement the reader's knowledge of the solitary Julian by placing the mystic's writing in the context of the vibrant, disease-ridden, and often violent life of 14th-century England. Each chapter is opened by a sentence from Julian's Revelations of Divine Love, the first book to be written in the English language by a woman. That seminal book becomes a focal point to narrate Julian's apparently evolving understanding of her inner life, her place in the broader social and religious movements of the time, and her relationship with those who sought her advice as a spiritual counselor. While the writer does a nice job of imagining a life for Julian, this book may be difficult for readers who prefer their facts footnoted, rather than implied between the lines. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

London: 1793. Young firebrand John Pearce, on the run from the authorities, is illegally press-ganged from the Pelican tavern into brutal life aboard HMS Brilliant, a frigate on its way to war. In the first few days Pearce discovers the Navy is a world in which he can prosper. But he is not alone; he is drawn to a group of men who eventually form an exclusive gun crew, the Pelicans, with Pearce their elected leader. Shipboard life is hard, brutal and dangerous. That anyone chooses it suggest that life ashore is worse. The Pelicans find solidarity in facing together the cruelty of their hard-nosed captain, Barclay, and the daily threat of bullying, flogging - even murder. The one light on the horizon is the captain&#39;s young, curvaceous wife, Emily. During an action-packed two weeks, as HMS Brilliant chases a French privateer across the English Channel, this disparate group of men form friendships that will last a lifetime. David Donachie cleverly weaves these fictional characters into true historical situations to produce a compelling and utterly absorbing introductory novel.</p><p>David Donachie was born in Edinburgh in 1944 and has had a variety of jobs, including selling everything from business machines to soap.

He was the Poet Laureate of the United States in 1990, and currently teaches at the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. He lives in Chicago.</p><p>Mark Strand is one of our finest contemporary American poets. The republication of <i>The Story of Our Lives, with The Monument and The Late Hour</i>, a collection of three out-of-print works written in the 1970s, is a testament to Strand's versatility and intellect. <i>The Story of Our Lives</i> is primarily an evocative lament for the author's deceased father, mulling over the questions and frustrations presented when someone close dies, as showcased in the deeply moving "Elegy for My Father": "It is over and nobody knows you." The second book, <i>The Monument</i>, could loosely be described as a series of prose poems utilizing lines from other works, such as those of Wallace Stevens, Walt Whitman, and Friedrich Nietzsche, as Strand presents an amusingly irreverent jab at the seriousness with which many poets (including himself) take themselves and their aspirations of having their works achieve immortality. The last book, <i>The Late Hour</i>, exhibits Strand's characteristic dreamlike quality--images have a sparse and haunting beauty about them, and patterns of quiet thought are reworked in a still, dark night. It's as if, while peering into that dark, one catches a glimpse of something in the periphery, and the residue of that brief image is what Strand explores--the space between what is and isn't there, between light and dark. Also, a prescient recitation of our aspirations of self-understanding and self-improvement can be found here, as in "Lines for Winter": "tell yourself / in that final flowing of cold through your limbs / that you love what you are." This collection serves as a welcome reintroduction to Mark Strand's earlier works. <i>--Michael Ferch</i>This book brings together for the first time three out-of-print works written in the 1970's by the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet&#x2014;-an essential for long-time and first-time readers alike.<br><br>It opens with the haunting "Elegy for My Father" <i>from The Story of Our Lives</i> (1973)&#x2014;-a powerful evocation of the emptiness, abandonment, and questioning that the dead leave to the living&#x2014;-and moves on to such poems as "Inside the Story," which illuminates the "insides" of love&#x2014;-the unspoken conversations between lovers, the arbitrary rules with which we guide our relationships.<br><br>The witty prose pieces from <i>The Monument</i> (1978) act as a reflective pause between the two poetry collections, commenting upon the immortality of poetry and the harmonious connection between the writer and his future readers. And, flowing seamlessly from these meditations, <i>The Late Hour</i> (1978) exemplifies the timeless power of lyric poetry, bringing us eloquent, lilting poems about the irretrievable past, the redemptive power of love, and the mysterious cycles of human existence: <br><br>"Again the late hour, the moon and stars,<br>the wounds of night that heal without sound, <br>again the luminous wind of morning that comes before the sun..."</p><h2>Brilliant Brick Builds: Amazing Creations in LEGO (R)</h2><p>Introduction by acclaimed LEGO artist, Nathan Sawaya Discover the best LEGO builds ever created with this celebration of the most impressive models from around the world.

This latest effort adds another gem in their long list. For these two authors, meditation is as important as breathing. They take the practice very seriously and yet make it so accessible, so easy to do and to do effectively. Plus, the spirit with which they approach meditation is inspiring. Few could read this latest book and not begin meditation straight away. Budgeting a little time each day to meditate seems like such a small request when you consider the benefits to one s psyche and physical health. According to Cayce and Van Auken, a little meditation pays big dividends physically, mentally, and spiritually, and it attracts the right opportunities and relationships for a happier, more fulfilling life.From the vital fundamentals to the most sophisticated techniques and concepts, this book delivers. It has focus and perspective. It has classical wisdom and modern know-how. It is a wonderfully inspiring read and a handy manual all in one. It is one of the best that team has published.</p><p>John Van Auken is an author and a speaker on reincarnation, karma, and higher consciousness. His extensive knowledge of the readings of American psychic Edgar Cayce, the Bible, world religions, and ancient Egypt is combined with years of practical application of these truths in his own life. He is a gifted speaker and has traveled extensively, conducting seminars throughout the United States and abroad. John resides in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Edgar Cayce was born in 1877 and lived until 1945. For more than forty years of his life, he gave what are called psychic readings. As a young man, he discovered that he had an unusual ability to put himself into an altered state of consciousness. He seemed to have access to virtually all knowledge. He was called the sleeping prophet&#34; and is the most documented psychic of our time. The book There is a River documents this fascinating man s life and has sold more than one million copies.</p><h2>George Stella&#39;s Good Carb Family Cookbook</h2><p>This is George&#39;s third and latest cookbook since his family lost over 500 pounds using his Good Carb recipes.

That&#39;s right, 467 pounds! I was only 39 years old, but I was suffering from congestive heart failure and living on disability. I couldn&#39;t even button the largest pair of pants I could find at the department store, so I used a safety pin instead and let my shirts hang down in front so no one could see. By then it didn&#39;t really matter anyway. I could hardly walk so I stayed home in a wheelchair most of the time. I couldn&#39;t even make it across the kitchen without stopping for a breather. Only a few years earlier I&#39;ve worked as a chef at some of the finest restaurants in Florida. Cafe Max, Sausalito Restaurant, Windows on the Green. The list goes on and on. I lost control of my life and I began to eat and then to eat even more. When it was all over I&#39;d eaten my way out of a life most chefs only dream of. My entire family was suffering with me. Collectively my wife, my two sons and I were overweight by over 500 pounds. By simply changing the way we ate we were able to lose those extra 500 pounds and we ve successfully kept it off for over eight years! My books tell you our story, how we got motivated and discovered the good carbs and eliminated the bad. We offer you the recipes that saved my life and have developed and perfected over the last eight years. They are our favorites. Enjoy!

For answers, you need insight into the Bible's culture, its people and how they lived.</p><p>What people wore, what they ate, what they built, how they exercised justice, how they mourned, how they viewed family and legal customs� all are "manners and customs" and all vary from period to period throughout Israel's history.</p><p>Fortunately, this book is a lot more than just nice pictures� although there are a lot of those, too. Each chapter furnishes an introduction to the political and physical setting of the period in Israel's history and outlines the basic structure of its social world. Then specific scenes drawn from the biblical text are studied in a way that sheds light on the daily life of the people of that time. Drawing from a variety of sources to recreate the society of ancient Israel� extrabiblical sources and archaeological data as well as the biblical text itself� Dr. Matthews helps the reader to see the ancient world of Israel as never before. Once seen in this way, it will never look the same again.</p><p>Now in a new, revised edition, Dr. Matthews offers even more helpful insights into the biblical world. Over a hundred Scripture passages have been placed alongside the text to complement the discussion and to keep the relevant biblical passages in view. More than twenty new illustrations and photos help to give an even better "feel" for the world of Abraham, David, Jesus, and Paul.</p></p><p>Victor H.

Witness the vicious attack from the perspective of a native - a young Saxon boy who dreams of the larger world, of better things, of heroes and myths and foreign gods. Are the Vikings what he's been waiting for?</p><p>This reader-friendly second collection of Wood's series, illustrated by Kelly, tells an engaging tale of cultures clashing. A self-contained story, it relates to the previous volume only as an overall portrayal of the impact of the Vikings in Europe in a way that doesn't reduce them to the familiar blustery stereotype of ocean-faring, land-pillaging warriors. This volume is set against the backdrop of Viking colonies in Ireland in the early 11th century, a land portrayed with a harsh beauty by Kelly's artwork. Magnus, an Irishman, blames the conquerors in his lands for robbing and killing his people, and so begins to kill Viking settlers near Dublin. Lord Ragnar Ragnarsson is sent to investigate these crimes. While Magnus hides in the countryside with his young daughter, Brigid, Ragnar and his band of men follow the trail of dead bodies Magnus leaves in his wake. The resulting bloodbath is also an effective psychological portrait of the two main characters in a highly enjoyable book that is as smart as it is action packed. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in England.Eddie Drood is back, in a contest with five up-and-comers in the spy game. Legendary independent agent Alexander King, on his deathbed, has devised a contest, the winner of which will get his secrets, lest they expire with him. The Drood family is roped into competing by hints that King knows who the traitor in its bosom is; the other five contestants, by promises of fame, glory, and whatever else they desire. Eddie and his fellow contestants range round the world to solve some of the greatest mysteries ever, from the truth about Nessie to that about Roswell, yet only one will win. King assumes they will backstab each other, and he&#x2019;s not entirely wrong. The Droods need to know who their traitor is, so Eddie will do everything necessary to win. There&#x2019;s more to the contest than simple mysteries, however, and Eddie gets to the bottom of things with style and a particularly cynical sense of humor.

Today's rock instruments and sound systems can be as technically sophisticated and complex as any Hollywood blockbuster. Rock Hardware explores the full range of choices in instruments and technology. including acoustic guitars, electric guitars, basses, amps, drums and percussion, keyboards, electronic music, brass, woodwinds, live sound systems, and recording technology. For rock fans, the book provides an inside look at 40 years of music history as seen and heard from the world's most famous stages and studios. For musicians, it gives invaluable insight into which instruments to choose from a vast array of old and new equipment, and how to combine them to create a distinctive new sound. The essays in this book have been written by fourteen of the world's leading music writers.Discussions of rock hardware are usually of interest only to rock musicians, as anyone who has ever been friends with one can attest. But this beautifully illustrated, well-written book manages to make the history of electric guitars, keyboards, winds, and even studio production and live sound recording both accessible and interesting to lay readers and musicians alike. Each of 14 chapter-essays focuses on the development and usage of an instrument or class of instruments in pop music.

Simultaneous.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2016:</strong> We&#x2019;ve been wondering lately: What is the secret sauce that makes novels like Anthony Doerr&#x2019;s <em>All the Light We Cannot See</em> and Kristin Hannah&#x2019;s <em>The Nightingale</em> so popular, stories set against the backdrop of WWII? Whatever it is, it made me approach Chris Cleave&#x2019;s <em>Everyone Brave is Forgiven</em> with a particularly wary eye. Sure, it&#x2019;s got all of the ingredients&#x2014;heroes and heroines who are flawed yet admirable. Check! A love story that manages to be poignant without being precious. Check! It even has cover art that is, as an astute colleague put it, a little cartoonish but appealingly &#x201c;Disney-London.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re a terrible cook like me, however, you know that you can have all of the right ingredients and still concoct something utterly inedible. But this couldn&#x2019;t be farther from the case with &#x2018;Brave,&#x2019; which was inspired by love letters that Cleave unearthed from his grandparents. The non-love story aspects of this novel are just as compelling, and add a layer of gravitas to a story that could easily slip into &#x201c;sudsy&#x201d; territory. These parts provide a chilling reminder that it wasn&#x2019;t just the Jews who were marginalized and punished during WWII, but black children, poor children, and the otherwise &#x201c;different&#x201d; or disenfranchised. Moreover, through the character of Mary North, &#x2018;Brave&#x2019; emphasizes the importance of challenging injustices. This timeless message is another key ingredient in what is sure to be another beloved (WWII) novel. <em>--Erin Kodicek</em>CHRIS CLEAVE is a columnist for &#34;The Guardian&#34; in London. His first novel, &#34;Incendiary,&#34; was published in 20 countries, won the 2006 Somerset Maugham Award and was shortlisted for the 2006 Commonwealth Writers&#39; Prize.

Platt looks at the subject of piracy from the time of ancient Greece to the 19th century in double-page topic treatments. Readers are introduced to privateers, buccaneers, and corsairs, and told how they differ. Illustrations of various types of pirate ships, and the merchant vessels that were most often their targets, are particularly effective. Unfortunately, maps are few and far between and those included are too small and poorly labeled to be of much use. Building contains all of the virtues of other "Eyewitness" books, but is hampered by trying to cover too much territory. The history of building techniques, materials, and philosophy from earth-and-thatch houses to cathedrals and skyscrapers is crammed into the 64-page format. Some of the technical terms introduced, e.g., "plinth," are not adequately explained, and there is no glossary. Despite their drawbacks, both books are suitable additions to libraries.?David N.

In the past 50 years, however, he has gained recognition as a major contributor to American representational art--owing in part to Stebbins's efforts to reawaken interest in Heade. This catalog accompanies a Heade retrospective that will travel, over the next ten months, to Boston, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. It includes biographical information about the artist, chapters on each type of subject he painted, a history of Heade criticism and scholarship, and a close analysis of his painting technique.

That is, until winter arrives. Bear is supposed to hibernate this time of year, but he doesn&#x2019;t want to miss out on any of the fun. But can Bear really stay awake all winter long? Gentle humor and endearing illustrations bring a delightful twist to a bedtime routine that children and their parents will easily recognize.</p><p>Ciara Gavin graduated from the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, Ireland. Her work appears in the National Museum of Decorative Arts and History there and has been exhibited at galleries throughout Ireland. She lives in Dublin with her son.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;In Room For Bear (Knopf, 2015), Gavin introduced Bear into the duck family, where they are now all living quite happily. So happily, in fact, that Bear does not want to hibernate and miss all the fun the rest of his family will be having. Therefore, he decides to stay awake. He has his winter clothes all ready, and he's not the least bit sleepy. Despite his best efforts and those of his siblings, Bear begins to fall asleep at the most inconvenient times&#x2014;while playing tennis, eating, boating, washing clothes, etc. Mama Duck finally explains that you can't fight who you are and sends Bear off to sleep with the promise that he won't miss a thing. When Bear awakes in the spring, she produces a photo album showing how he was included all winter long. Gavin's sweet and amusing illustrations of ducks and Bear are just as endearing in this story as in the first book. The warm watercolor and pencil depictions are matched with simple, uncluttered text. The end page shows charming "photos" of how Bear was included in the family all winter long.

When his men came to investigate, the carcass has disappeared, leaving only a trail in the sand. Then his home is ransacked and the inspector is certain that the crimes are linked. As he negotiates both the glittering underworld of horseracing and the Mafia's connection to it, Montalbano is aided by his illiterate housekeeper, Adelina, and a Proustian memory of <i>linguate fritte</i>. Longtime fans and new readers alike will be charmed by Montalbano's blend of unorthodox methods, melancholy self-reflection, and love of good food.</p><p><b>Andrea Camilleri</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of the popular Inspector Montalbano Mystery series, as well as a number of historical novels that take place in Sicily.

From this peculiar equine beginning, Montalbano soon finds himself embroiled in a puzzling case that involves horse stealing, race fixing, and murder. Along the way, of course, there is plenty of time for lunch, though Montalbano&#x2019;s ability to concentrate on his food is impeded by two women who seem more than willing to fill the gap created by Livia&#x2019;s absence. This series is distinguished by Camilleri&#x2019;s remarkable feel for tragicomedy, expertly mixing light and dark in the course of producing novels that are both comforting and disturbing. Here he leans a bit more toward the light side, but fans won&#x2019;t mind a little extra comfort one bit. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Reason in Philosophy: Animating Ideas</h2><p><p>Transcendentalism never came to an end in America. It just went underground for a stretch, but is back in full force in Robert Brandom&#x2019;s new book. Brandom takes up Kant and Hegel and explores their contemporary significance as if little time had expired since intellectuals gathered around Emerson in Concord to discuss reason and idealism, selves, freedom, and community. Brandom&#x2019;s discussion belongs to a venerable tradition that distinguishes us as rational animals, and philosophy by its concern to understand, articulate, and explain the notion of reason that is thereby cast in that crucial demarcating role.</p><p>An emphasis on our capacity to reason, rather than merely to represent, has been growing in philosophy over the last thirty years, and Robert Brandom has been at the center of this development. <i>Reason in Philosophy</i> is the first book that gives a succinct overview of his understanding of the role of reason as the structure at once of our minds and our meanings&#x2015;what constitutes us as free, responsible agents. The job of philosophy is to introduce concepts and develop expressive tools for expanding our self-consciousness as sapients: explicit awareness of our discursive activity of thinking and acting, in the sciences, politics, and the arts. This is a paradigmatic work of contemporary philosophy.</p></p><p>Robert B. Brandom is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Fellow of the Center for Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh.This work is a formidable achievement that demonstrates deep historical knowledge and awesome hermeneutic and systematic philosophical powers that, in this degree, are conjoined at best in a handful of people alive. This is in every way a superior work of philosophy, and shows why Robert Brandom holds a singular position in the discipline worldwide. (Sebastian R�dl, Universit�t Basel.)<br><br>This book represents a new collection of papers by one of the most important systematic philosophical thinkers of our time. As such it will be welcomed by those already familiar with Brandom's thought. At the same time, by connecting his views to familiar historical themes, Brandom has provided what is, to my mind, the most accessible route into his often dauntingly complex ideas, a route strongly recommended to those new to his work.

The popularity of art deco during the 1920s and 19302s influenced modernist designers in many fields: ceramics, textiles, interiors, glassware, furniture, as well as architecture. <br><br>In the roaring twenties both the glorification of technology and the frivolity of the flapper decade were celebrated in art deco design. Seen most notably in New York City's Chrysler and Empire State buildings, the jazzy art deco style known as skyscraper or zigzag abounded until 1931. Then, with the economic depression years of the 1930s, the thriftier and less extravagant streamline and classical moderne styles came to the forefront. <br><br>Many of art deco's greatest practitioners worked in several media to produce exuberant buildings with seductive art deco interiors. Frank Lloyd Wright, Ely Jacques Kahn, and Eliel Saarinen were just a few of the architects who produced bold and vital art deco designs. This volume exquisitely reproduced the rich heritage of art deco design, from Sidney Waugh's glassware for Steuben Glass and Grant Wood's paintings to Donald Deskey's interiors in Radio City Music Hall and William Van Alen's Chrysler Building.</p><p></p><h2>7 Steps to Becoming Financially Free: A Catholic Guide to Managing Your Money</h2><p>Discover True Financial Freedom!<br><br>Packed with anecdotes and real life experiences, 7 Steps to Becoming Financially Free offers a solid Catholic perspective on how to make the most of God's generous gifts.

Reprint.</p><p>Nebula finalist Paul Di Filippo follows <i>The Steampunk Trilogy</i>, a collection of alternate-history novellas, with <i>Ribofunk</i>, a biotechnological hard-SF collection. As the radical shift of genres may indicate, <i>Ribofunk</i> is astonishingly diverse in subjects and styles, even though its 13 stories make up a future history. Despite the generous number of stories, the book's quality and creativity remain high throughout. In "Brain Wars," a genetically engineered disease afflicts an Antarctic army with enough psychobiological horrors to frighten even the famed neurologist Oliver Sacks. In "The Boot," a 2060s-era private investigator seeks a bio-enhanced thief-gambler who can see the dynamics of chaos and may therefore be able to beat any odds, even those of capture. In "The Bad Splice," the PI finds himself trapped alone in the superseaweed-choked, storm-torn North Atlantic with the diabolical Krazy Kat, a "splice," or genetically engineered animal-man, who has escaped bondage and become a splice-rights terrorist.

As the head of the feared SS, Himler supervised the extermination of millions. Here is the story of how a seemingly ordinary boy grew into an obsessive and superstitious man who ventured into herbalism, astrology, and homeopathic medicine before finally turning to the &#34;science&#34; of racial purity and the belief in the superiority of the Aryan people.</p><p></p><h2>Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 3: Courtney Crumrin In The Twilight Kingdom</h2><p>Courtney has changed schools yet again, but this time she&#39;s in the Coven&#39;s special class for magical studies.

After a successful run, Ted decided to strike out on his own, writing and drawing Courtney Crumrin and the Night Things, a spooky children&#x2019;s fantasy series about a grumpy little girl and her adventures with her Warlock uncle. Nominated for an Eisner Award for best limited series, Courtney Crumrin&#x2019;s success paved the way for Polly and the Pirates, another children&#x2019;s book, this time about a prim and proper girl kidnapped by pirates convinced she was the daughter of their long-lost queen. Over the next few years, Ted wrote four volumes of Courtney Crumrin, plus a spin off book about her uncle. He also co-created How Loathsome with Tristan Crane, and illustrated two volumes of the videogame tie-in comic Death Junior with screenwriter Gary Whitta. More recently, he illustrated The Good Neighbors, a three volume graphic novel series written by New York Times best-selling author Holly Black, published by Scholastic. In 2011, Ted wrote the sequel to Polly and the Pirates, and illustrated several Batman short stories for DC Comics. In 2012, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Courtney Crumrin, he wrote and illustrated the final two volumes of the series. Currently, you can find Ted everywhere: from the pages of Batman &#x2018;66 to his newest original series for adults, Night&#x2019;s Dominion.

Particularly in China and Iran (Persia), the results were far-reaching: the Mongols imposed enormous changes but were also influenced by the highly developed civilizations of their new subjects. During the century they ruled Iran - the period of the Ilkhanid dynasty (1256 to 1353) - the Mongols adopted Islam and sponsored a brilliant cultural flowering that encompassed many branches of the arts and transformed local Persian artistic traditions. This volume, which focuses on the Ilkhans and their culture, features some 200 extraordinary objects in colour, including manuscript paintings and illuminations, ceramic tiles, metalwork and textiles. Essays by eight scholars provide the historical and political background and address such subjects as the art of the book, religious art, and the transmission of designs across Asia.</p><p>Published in association with The Metropolitan Museum of ArtLinda Komaroff is Curator of Islamic Art and Head of the Department of Ancient and Islamic Art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Stefano Carboni is Associate Curator in the Department of Islamic Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><h2>MEMORY OF FIRE: VOL 3-CENT WIN (Memory of Fire Trilogy)</h2><p><p><strong>From pre-Columbian creation myths and the first European voyages of discovery and conquest to the Age of Reagan, here is "nothing less than a unified history of the Western Hemisphere... recounted in vivid prose."-<em>The New Yorker</em></strong></p>A unique and epic history, Eduardo Galeano's <em>Memory of Fire</em> trilogy is an outstanding Latin American eye view of the making of the New World.

Reprint.</p><p>Despite growing up in a one-room cabin in Virginia, Napoleon Hill went on to attract a worldwide following of movers and shakers who were drawn to his philosophy of personal motivation espoused in such bestselling books as <i>Think and Grow Rich</i>.

In Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, a man convicted of a bloody murder lives in prison brutally ruled by a sadistic warden and secretly run by a con who knows all the ropes and pulls all the strings. He has more brains than anyone else in this sinister slammer, and a diabolically cunning plan of revenge that no one can guess until it&#39;s too late. And brace yourself for icy shock in three more stunning novellas of suspense. Four young boys come face to face with life, death and hints of their own mortality...A teenager becomes both the puppet and the puppet master of evil...A disgraced woman is determined to triumph over death. The greatest horror master of our time turns the screws of suspense to lock you into terrifying tension and nerve-tingling twists.</p><p><i>Different Seasons</i> (1982) is a collection of four novellas, markedly different in tone and subject, each on the theme of a journey. The first is a rich, satisfying, nonhorrific tale about an innocent man who carefully nurtures hope and devises a wily scheme to escape from prison. The second concerns a boy who discards his innocence by enticing an old man to travel with him into a reawakening of long-buried evil. In the third story, a writer looks back on the trek he took with three friends on the brink of adolescence to find another boy's corpse. The trip becomes a character-rich rite of passage from youth to maturity.<p> These first three novellas have been made into well-received movies: "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption" into Frank Darabont's 1994 <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> (available as a screenplay, a DVD film, and an audiocassette), "Apt Pupil" into Bryan Singer's 1998 film <i>Apt Pupil</i> (also released in 1998 on audiocassette), and "The Body" into Rob Reiner's <i>Stand by Me</i> (1986).</p><p> The final novella, "Breathing Lessons," is a horror yarn told by a doctor, about a patient whose indomitable spirit keeps her baby alive under extraordinary circumstances. It's the tightest, most polished tale in the collection. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947.

We were the first black band that played the Paramount Theater, downtown New York. Not Duke Ellington, not Count Basie. Six weeks in a row, four or five shows daily, and it was packed every day, people lining up around the corner constantly! We could outdraw any band in the country."<br>---Gerald Wilson</p><p>"Jimmie Lunceford was a key swing-era figure, and no book covers his biography and music like this one does. Grounded in years of research and inspired by the writer's love of his subject, the book fills a critical gap in the jazz literature and will be essential reading for all swing aficionados."<br>---Jeffrey Magee, Associate Professor of Musicology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and author of <i>The Uncrowned King of Swing: Fletcher Henderson and Big Band Jazz</i></p><p>"It was Jimmie Lunceford and his orchestra that inspired me to become a musician. I was eleven years old at the time. When I heard that band play I said to myself, 'That's for me. I want to become a musician.' I still get inspired when I listen to some of their recordings. The Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra is one of the great jazz orchestras of all time."<br>---Horace Silver</p><p>"Jimmie Lunceford has the best of all bands. Duke is great, Basie is remarkable, but Lunceford tops them both."<br>---Glenn Miller</p><p>In the 1930s, swing music reigned, and the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra was the hottest and hippest attraction on the black dance circuits. Known for its impeccable appearance and infectious rhythms, Lunceford's group was able to out-swing and outdraw any band. For ten consecutive years, they were the best-loved attraction at Harlem's famed Apollo Theater. The group's hit recordings sold in the hundreds of thousands, and Jimmie Lunceford's band rivaled Ellington's for popularity in the African American community.</p><p>Jimmie Lunceford was also an innovator, elevating big-band showmanship to an art and introducing such novel instruments as the electric guitar and bass. The band's arrangements, written by Sy Oliver, Edwin Wilcox, Gerald Wilson, Billy Moore, Jr., and Tadd Dameron, were daring and forward looking, influencing generations of big-band writers.</p><p><i>Rhythm Is Our Business</i> traces the development of the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra from its infant days as a high school band in Memphis to its record-breaking tours across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The book also unveils Lunceford's romantic yet ill-fated involvement with Yolande Du Bois, daughter of famous writer and opinion leader W.E.B. Du Bois. And by reconstructing Lunceford's last day, the book offers a glimpse into the mysteries surrounding the leader's untimely death. This is essential reading for anyone interested in the history and legacy of swing.</p><p>Eddy Determeyer has been a freelance music journalist for more than three decades.

Until a call from Lexi changes everything...&nbsp;<br><br>Cade has been gone too long. His foster mother is hospitalized, and the ranch is in deep financial trouble. Yet even as his world crumbles, Cade's hunger for Lexi is almost as tangible as the taste of her lips and the way her body fits deliciously against his. It's bittersweet surrender. But Lexi isn't the girl she used to be, and she's determined to have the hot cowboy in her bed only if she keeps him out of her heart.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Vicki Lewis Thompson&#x2019;s love affair with cowboys started with the Lone Ranger, continued through Maverick and took a turn south of the border with Zorro.&nbsp;Fortunately for her, she lives in the Arizona desert, where broad-shouldered, lean-hipped cowboys abound.&nbsp; Visit her website at www.vickilewisthompson.com."Ringo, this is shaping up to be a disaster." Cade leaned down to give the gray tabby a good scratch. Ringo's motor started up, and the soothing purr lifted Cade's spirits, but not by much. Whenever he glanced at the glossy black horse peering at him over the stall door, anxiety curdled in his gut.<br><br>A couple of hours ago, his boss at the Circle T had vowed to sell Hematite to a meatpacking plant. Dick Thornwood was the kind of SOB who would do it, too, so Cade had driven into Colorado Springs and emptied his bank account. He had more in his pocket than Thornwood could get at a slaughterhouse, so logically Thornwood should sell the horse to him instead.<br><br>But logic wasn't his boss's strong suit, especially when his pride had been wounded. His decision to ride Hematite earlier that afternoon had been ill-advised, and to make matters worse, he'd chosen to do it with his new girlfriend watching. Cade had tried to talk him out of it, but he'd insisted. Hematite had tossed him in the dirt.<br><br>Just as Cade had predicted he would. They were mere days into the training program, and Hematite had major issues. He'd been mistreated as a colt and gelding him hadn't done much to settle him down. He'd just begun to trust Cade, who'd managed to saddle him for the first time today. Too bad Thornwood had seen that and decided to show off for his lady friend.<br><br>When he'd been dumped on his ass, she'd laughed. Thornwood had sent her packing, and then, shaking with rage, he'd approached the horse. Thank God he hadn't had a gun. Instead he'd delivered Hematite's death sentence before stomping up to the house.<br><br>Cade had been nervous about leaving for the bank, so he'd asked Douglas, the foreman, to keep an eye on Hematite. Fortunately nothing happened. Thornwood was likely up at the house drinking. Cade had brought fast food with him so he could stay in the barn and keep watch over the horse all night.<br><br>Footsteps on the wooden barn floor jacked up his heart rate, but it turned out to be Douglas coming back, probably to check on them.<br><br>"The way that feline dotes on you, anybody'd think your pockets were stuffed with catnip." Douglas nudged back his hat and leaned against Hematite's stall. "You should probably take him when you leave or he'll die of a broken heart."<br><br>"Who says I'm leaving?"<br><br>"I saw your face when Thornwood started to go for that horse. Looked to me like you wanted to kill him."<br><br>"The thought occurred to me, but then I decided he wasn't worth it." Cade worked his fingers over Ringo's arched back, and the cat purred louder. "But yeah, I figure my time here is about up. I just have to work out the logistics."<br><br>"That's why I came to talk to you. You can borrow my horse trailer."<br><br>Cade glanced up. "Really? You don't need it?"<br><br>Douglas shrugged. "Not until next spring. If you can get it back to me by April, that'll be fine."<br><br>"I'll have it back real quick. I called a buddy over at the Bar Z and he said they might be able to use another hand, at least for the summer. I'll head there once I get Thornwood to sell me this horse."<br><br>The foreman sighed. "I dunno. He's crazy."<br><br>"Thornwood or the horse?"<br><br>"Thornwood. The horse is just scared."<br><br>"Yeah. Hematite can't stay here. Even before today's incident, I thought Thornwood and Hematite were a bad combination."<br><br>"You got your stuff together?"<br><br>Cade nodded. "Figured once the shit hit the fan, I needed to be ready to go. I&#x2014;" The sound of heavy, deliberate footsteps and the jingle of spurs made whatever he'd been about to say irrelevant. Heart pounding, he rose to his feet as Dick Thornwood came toward them. He held a coiled stock whip in one hand and a rope in the other. The fires of hell shone in his pale eyes.<br><br>Douglas swore under his breath, and Ringo crept behind a hay bale.<br><br>As Cade faced his boss, his heart rate slowed and icy calm replaced the initial adrenaline rush. He knew that unholy expression well. Bullies were all alike. His father, Rance, had looked exactly like that after he'd been drinking, except he'd vented his rage on Cade and his mother, not on a horse. Finally Cade had grown tall enough to stop him and his father had left.<br><br>Positioning himself in front of the stall door, Cade fixed his gaze on Thornwood. "I'll buy him from you."<br><br>Thornwood kept coming, bourbon on his breath. "He's not for sale."<br><br>"I thought you wanted him destroyed."<br><br>"I've reconsidered." He reached the stall. "Stand aside, Gallagher."<br><br>"No."<br><br>Thornwood's nostrils flared. "I <i>said</i> stand aside, cowboy!"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Dropping the rope, Thornwood uncoiled the whip. "Move it!"<br><br>"Touch me with that whip and I'll charge you with assault. And I have a witness."<br><br>Thornwood's jaw worked. "You're fired, asshole."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"And I'm not selling you that damned horse!"<br><br>"Why not?" He kept his tone conversational. "I'll give you more than you'd get at the slaughterhouse, and I'll take him off your hands. You can be rid of both of us tonight."<br><br>A vein pulsed at Thornwood's temple as his face reddened. "I'd rather beat the shit out of both of you." He sneered at Cade. "And your precious witness won't say a damned thing about it."<br><br>Cade raised his eyebrows. "You think he'd lie for you?"<br><br>"I do." Thornwood snapped the whip against the barn floor.<br><br>"I wouldn't count on it." Cade widened his stance.<br><br>"But if you're determined to pick a fight with me, bring it on." He held Thornwood's gaze. "Take your best shot."<br><br>A flicker in those pale eyes told Cade all he needed to know. Bullies chose fights they were certain they could win, and Thornwood was no longer so certain, even with that whip.<br><br>Sure enough, he backed up a step and his lip curled. "You're not worth the energy. Get the hell off my ranch. And take that nag with you." He pivoted toward the barn's entrance.<br><br>"Oh, no, you don't! You're selling him to me, not giving him away. I don't intend to get jailed for stealing your horse."<br><br>Thornwood paused but didn't turn around. "How much you got?"<br><br>Cade gave him a figure, everything he had in his pocket minus what he needed to carry him until he had another job.<br><br>"Give it to Lindstrom. He'll handle it." Thornwood stalked out of the barn.<br><br>Douglas blew out a breath. "Damn. That was close."<br><br>"He's just like my old man. Once you stand up to guys like that, they fold."<br><br>"Not always."<br><br>"No, not always." Cade had challenged his dad before he could back up the threat, and he had the scars to prove it. He dug the roll of bills out of his pocket. "I want something in writing that says I own this horse. Something with his signature on it."<br><br>"I'll see to it. You hitch up the trailer and get him loaded. I'll have a signed bill of sale for you before you leave."<br><br>"Thanks. I'll need to take the halter, too, and borrow a lead rope. Is that going to be a problem?"<br><br>"Nah. If he even brings it up, I'll tell him you'll return those when you return my trailer."<br><br>"I couldn't manage this without you." Cade gazed at the foreman. "I appreciate the help."<br><br>"Glad to do it."<br><br>"I won't be that far away. We can still get together for a beer once in a while."<br><br>"I'd like that." The foreman pocketed the money. "Better get moving before he changes his mind."<br><br>"Right. See you in a few." Cade fished for his keys and headed out the back to fetch his truck. He really was going to miss the crusty old foreman.<br><br>His reason for gravitating toward him in the first place was no mystery. He resembled Cade's foster father&#x2014;about the same age with a similar wiry build and a no-nonsense attitude. Cade hadn't set foot on Thunder Mountain Ranch in... Damn, had it really been five years?<br><br>He talked to Herb and Rosie on the phone several times a year and always on Christmas Eve, but he'd avoided an actual visit because of Lexi. That was a chickenshit reason. He needed to man up and make the trip, although he couldn't expect vacation days for a while if he was about to start a new job.<br><br>Climbing into his truck, he drove behind the bunk-house and hitched up Douglas's trailer. Then he took a moment to call his buddy at the Bar Z to make sure spending the night there was still an option. Tomorrow Cade would talk to the owner about a job, and with luck he'd be employed again in no time. That was important, especially when he had another mouth to feed.<br><br>Convincing Thornwood to sell had been the easy part of this rescue operation. Now he had to get that high-strung horse in the trailer. The previous owner, the one who'd mishandled Hematite's training, had given him a heavy-duty tranquilizer so he'd load. The drugged horse had staggered down the ramp the day he'd arrived.<br><br>This time Hematite would have to load and unload cold turkey. Cade considered that as he drove his truck around to the front of the barn. Lowering the ramp, he paused and took several deep breaths before going back into the barn.<br><br>His behavior would influence the horse, so the calmer he stayed, the better chance he'd have of keeping Hematite mellow. He visualized the horse walking quietly out of his stall, down the wooden aisle of the barn, then moving up into the trailer without hesitation.<br><br>Grabbing the rattiest-looking lead rope from the tack room, he started toward Hematite's stall. The horse watched him, ears pricked forward. Cade usually saved his next technique for when he was alone with a horse. Nobody else was in the barn, so he began singing "Red River Valley." Thanks to his time at Thunder Mountain Ranch, he had a whole repertoire of camp-fire songs, and normally they worked like a charm to settle nervous horses.<br><br>He'd only sung to Hematite a couple of times, though. They hadn't developed a singing routine, but at this point anything was worth a try. He continued the sweet love song as he unlatched the stall door and stepped inside.<br><br>Hematite snorted and edged away. Still singing, Cade approached and managed to clip the lead rope onto the horse's halter. Then he turned and walked out of the stall as if he thoroughly expected Hematite to follow him, no questions asked. The horse did.<br><br>Cade finished "Red River Valley" and moved on to "Tumbling Tumbleweeds." He sang in rhythm with the steady clip-clop of Hematite's hooves on the barn floor. Meanwhile he continued to visualize a smooth entrance into the horse trailer.<br><br>Out the barn door. Up the ramp. Cade kept singing. About three minutes later, the horse was loaded and the trailer doors secured. Cade stood there grinning and shaking his head in disbelief. That horse would be serenaded from now on.<br><br>"That's about the slickest thing I ever did see." Douglas came toward him from the direction of the house. "Were you <i>singing</i> to that animal?"<br><br>"Um, yeah." Cade chuckled. "If you use the term loosely."<br><br>"You're no George Strait, but at least I could recognize the tune. I've heard of using songs to calm a herd of cattle, but I never thought of trying it with horses. How long you been doing that?"<br><br>"Three or four years, I guess."<br><br>"No kidding. How'd you come up with it?"<br><br>"By accident. One day I was riding along, humming to myself for some reason, and I could feel my horse relax. So then I tried humming when I worked with a problem horse, and that seemed to help. I don't know if singing is any better than humming, but it's more interesting for me."<br><br>"I'll be damned." Douglas rubbed a hand over his jaw. "I'll just have to try it. Although I sound like a mating bullfrog, so it might not work for me. Can't believe I've known you for almost two years and never realized you were a singing cowboy."<br><br>Cade laughed. "I wouldn't go that far."<br><br>"I would. You're a cowboy. You sing. Case closed. Oh, and here's your bill of sale, complete with Thorn-wood's signature. He's had enough to drink that he doesn't care about much of anything, so he was more than happy to sign."<br><br>"Thank you." Cade took the paper, opened it to check the signature and refolded it. "You have my cell number. If he gives you any grief about this after he sobers up, let me know."<br><br>"I doubt he will. I'll wager that by tomorrow he'll have rewritten history. He'll tell everyone he gave you the deal of a lifetime because he's such a great guy and he felt sorry for you."<br><br>"He can make up any story he wants as long as he leaves me and this horse alone."<br><br>"I think he will, but if I get any hint that he's on the warpath, I'll give you a holler."<br><br>"Thanks, Douglas." He shook the foreman's hand. "Don't forget. We're going to have that beer someday soon."<br><br>"I'm counting on it."<br><br>Climbing into the truck, Cade glanced around at the place he'd called home for eighteen months. It hadn't really been home, of course. Thunder Mountain was the only place that fit that description. Thornwood had been a lousy boss, but Douglas had made up for that. So it was with mixed feelings that Cade put the truck in gear and pulled away from the Circle T.<br><br>He'd made it to the main road by the time Ringo decided to show himself. The gray tabby crawled from the space behind the passenger seat and settled himself on the worn upholstery. Immediately he began to purr.<br><br>Cade sighed. He should probably turn around and take Ringo back to the Circle T. "Look, I'm heading over to a ranch that may have a territorial barn cat for all I know. You might not be welcome there. Then what?"<br><br>Ringo blinked at him and purred louder.<br><br>Cade's chest tightened. He'd never had a pet of his own. Dogs and cats had been a constant presence at Thunder Mountain Ranch, but they'd been loved and cared for by all the boys. Cade remembered each one fondly, but he'd never felt the deep connection that he'd formed with Ringo. Apparently Ringo returned the sentiment, because here he was ready to follow Cade wherever the road led.<br><br>"Okay, cat. We'll figure it out."<br><br>As if he understood that the matter was settled, Ringo curled up on the seat and closed his eyes.<br><br>That kind of trust was rare in this world. Cade hadn't experienced it often. He could count on one hand the people who trusted him like that&#x2014;Herb, Rosie, Damon, Finn, Douglas. Not Lexi.<br><br>If Ringo was offering him that level of trust, he'd be a fool not to take it and be grateful. He'd also be very careful not to betray it. He knew what abandonment felt like, and he wouldn't wish that on any creature.<br><br>Lexi might think he'd abandoned her, but he'd been very careful not to make promises he couldn't keep. That's what he told himself whenever guilty memories of her anger and her tears plagued him. She'd had expectations he couldn't meet. According to Lexi, some things were just understood. Not in his world. He was a guy who spelled everything out, and he'd never, ever said he'd marry her.<br><br>The Bar Z was only a forty-five-minute drive from the Circle T. About halfway there, Cade's cell phone rang. He pulled it off its holder on the dash, expecting a call from his buddy or maybe from Douglas.<br><br>Instead he stared in disbelief at the name on the screen. Lexi Simmons. Damned spooky, as if she'd tuned in to his thoughts and picked up the phone.<br><br>But he did...</p><h2>Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare</h2><p>In 16th century England many loyal subjects to the crown were asked to make a terrible choice: to follow their monarch or their God. The era was one of unprecedented authoritarianism: England, it seemed, had become a police state, fearful of threats from abroad and plotters at home. This age of terror was also the era of the greatest creative genius the world has ever known: William Shakespeare. How, then, could such a remarkable man born into such violently volatile times apparently make no comment about the state of England in his work?<p> He did. But it was hidden. Revealing Shakespeare's sophisticated version of a forgotten code developed by 16th-century dissidents, Clare Asquith shows how he was both a genius for all time and utterly a creature of his own era: a writer who was supported by dissident Catholic aristocrats, who agonized about the fate of England's spiritual and political life and who used the stage to attack and expose a regime which he believed had seized illegal control of the country he loved.</p><p> Shakespeare's plays offer an acute insight into the politics and personalities of his era. And Clare Asquith's decoding of them offers answers to several mysteries surrounding Shakespeare's own life, including most notably why he stopped writing while still at the height of his powers. An utterly compelling combination of literary detection and political revelation, <b>Shadowplay</b> is the definitive expose of how Shakespeare lived through and understood the agonies of his time, and what he had to say about them.</p></p><p><b>Clare Asquith</b> has lectured on Shakespeare in England and Canada. Her article on <i>The Phoenix and the Turtle</i> was published in 2001 by the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, and her essay on <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> appeared this year in Shakespeare and the <i>Culture of Christianity</i> in Early Modern England. She lives in London.&#34;It is rare when a work of such painstaking scholarship is so dramatic, important and exciting to read. Lucidly and persuasively, Clare Asquith takes us through the complexities of religious politics in Elizabethan England, and reveals the anguished debates hidden in Shakespeare&#39;s plays. Shadowplay solves many of the puzzles that have perplexed scholars over the years, dramatically enhances our understanding of the dramas of our greatest playwright and, in my view, will lead to a seismic shift in our understanding of our past.&#34; Piers Paul Read &#34;Clare Asquith is an inspired and compelling code-breaker - her fascinating study takes us into the concealed heart of the English identity and shows that the Catholic Shakespeare was an exemplary and committed writer, not simply the famously protean bard who resists all attempts to pin down his beliefs. Shadowplay is a remarkable and exciting work of scholarship which shows us the deep structures of Shakespeare&#39;s imagination.&#34; Tom Paulin, G. M. Young Lecturer in English at Hertford College, Oxford, editor of The Faber Book of Political Verse (1986) and The Faber Book of Vernacular Poetry (1990) &#34;... even if only half of Clare Asquith&#39;s argument turns out to be correct, she&#39;s written the most visceral, challenging, compelling book on Shakespeare&#39;s place in history we&#39;ve had for over 20 years.&#34; Dr John Guy, Winner of the Whitbread Biography Award, 2004 &#39;This book shows us the enticing possibilities of what is certainly needed, a reading of the works which, with real inwardness, takes seriously their rootedness in the poet&#39;s increasingly discernible intent: to speak for (and to) a network of men and women living double lives within the English establishment, and to deploy the freshly available resources of English and European poetic and dramatic form in memorializing those lives by making them transcend their time and their predicament.&#39; John Finnis, Professor of Law and Legal Philosophy, University College Oxford &#34;The politics of language is back in fashion, and in this book we have a daring excursus into the field of oppositional discourse in the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods. Here we are introduced to the workings of a dissident religion that very much dares, even if in code, to speak its name. Scholars will have to think again about how far Shakespeare&#39;s faith and his view of the Reformation, inflected contemporaries&#39; understanding of the controversies over the Church in England.&#34; Dr Michael Questier, Lecturer in Early Modern British and European history, Queen Mary College, University of London&#34; &#34;Clare Asquith&#39;s textual criticism is a marvel; eminently readable scholarship&#34;. Sir John Keegan, Daily Telegraph Defence Editor and author of The Face of Battle &#34;This is a book of thrilling scholarship and great daring. Any venture into Shakespearean investigation requires panache, deep affection for &#34;the man&#34; and a delicate balance between nerve and learning. Clare Asquith has rendered all of these elegantly and has also, uniquely, kept pace with the great emotions in the works she scrutinizes.&#34; Frank Delaney &#34;A literary detective story, which is quite riveting.&#34; Antonia Fraser &#34;So mysteriously little is chronicled about Shakespeare that his life, nature and beliefs lie open to endless speculation. What Clare Asquith has done in Shadowplay is to infinitely widen our perception of who he was. She shows how, despite the rule of terror successfully imposed by the father and son, William and Robert Cecil, Shakespeare throughout his play converses with his contemporary audience in an entirely accessible code that has been lost until now by us. This book is a masterpiece of sustained scholarship that reads like a detective novel.&#34; Harriet Waugh &#34;The book, set to cause controversy among experts, is full of such detailed analysis and reads, as historian Antonia Fraser has said, &#39;like a literary detective story.&#39;&#34; Vanessa Thorpe, The Observer &#34;As incendiary religious theories go, it&#39;s right up there with The Da Vinci Code.&#34; The Independent &#34;I did find reading Shadowplay was like reading a thriller.&#34; James Naughtie, Today Programme &#34;Among the most remarkable books to come out about Shakespeare in years... If she is even partly right, her book represents a small earthquake in our understanding.&#34; Sam Leith in The Spectator &#34;(N) obody can fail to be impressed by the verve with which (Clare Asquith) writes, bringing a lost world to life&#34;. James Shapiro in the Daily Telegraph &#34;Asquith&#39;s learned new book is valuable for the new light it sheds on Shakespeare&#39;s life amid the dark religious dangers of Elizabethan and Jacobean England, and for the new suggestions she makes about such mysteries as his abrupt retirement from writing.&#34; Anthony Holden in the Daily Mail &#34;This is one of the most astonishing and original books ever written about Shakespeare... Clare Asquith has produced a wonderfully stimulating read.... (this is) one of the most important books ever written about his plays.&#34; The Catholic Herald &#34;Shadowplay turns a period in English history on its head as well as our most important playwright&#39;s role in the time. Thanks to Asquith&#39;s ability to decode and clarify his dissident yet patriotic message, the author&#39;s simply explained, painstaking research leads the reader down mysterious alleys with the same ease as the best thriller writer. Shadowplay is a masterpiece of precise scholarship uncovering England&#39;s most brilliant playwright&#39;s politics, religious beliefs and dramatic fight for his country&#39;s freedoms. The &#34;Merrie England&#34; of Elizabeth I is no longer the liberated country presided over by an enlightened monarch as we have been taught, but a far darker place. As always, history is owned by its architects, Elizabeth&#39;s and her regime. Now hitherto unexplained mysteries about Shakespeare&#39;s life and beliefs are brilliantly laid out for us.&#34; Leonie Frieda in The Evening Standard &#34;Clare Asquith&#39;s Shadowplay... is a fascinating literary detective story and has stirred up controversy as everything to do with Shakespeare - and the Gunpowder Plot - always does.&#34; Antonia Fraser - Books of the Year in the Sunday Telegraph &#34;Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare by Clare Asquith looks at the complexities of religious politics in Elizabethan England, revealing the anguished debates hidden in Shakespeare&#39;s plays. Piers Paul Read - Books of the Year in The Times &#34;Clare Asquith&#39;s Shadowplay: The Hidden Beliefs and Coded Politics of William Shakespeare (Public Affairs, GBP 18.99) is an audacious, compelling literary/historical investigation that challenges our assumptions about the plays, the playwright and English history itself. I am no expert on Shakespeare, but found her account of how the perilous day-to-day politics of Elizabethan England affected Shakespeare&#39;s dramas wholly convincing.&#34; Piers Paul Read - Books of the Year in The Spectator &#39;In Shadowplay (Public Affairs, GBP 18.99), Clare Asquith builds up a detailed argument for William Shakespeare having expressed his Catholic beliefs through a series of coded images. As the historian A.W. Kinglake wanted inscribed on churches: &#34;Important if true. Intriguing in any case.&#39;&#34; Christopher Howse - Books of the Year in The Tablet &#34;... passionately argued, compellingly readable... gracefully and persuasively (Claire Asquith) pulls together the findings of those who have labored before her in the academic vineyard.&#34; Los Angeles Times &#34;Asquith smashes the familiar icon of Shakespeare as a determined conformist who brilliantly skated the political thin ice that cracked under his less skillful countrymen. Her Shakespeare is darker and more complex - a tormented dissident who died in defeat. Asquith is far from alone in her conjectures. The portrait that is emerging shows that Shakespeare was a hero as magnificent as any he created.&#34; Washington Post&#34;</p><h2>Aztec Art</h2><p>1993 Edition.

As a comparatively young man, he published three compelling novels and a collection of short stories, then remained almost silent for the rest of his life, the victim of a paralyzing case of writer&#x2019;s block.

Benson masterfully balances his engaging account of the experiences, people, and settings of Clark&#x2019;s life with a penetrating examination of his complex psyche and the crippling perfectionism that virtually ended Clark&#x2019;s career, as well as offering up a thoughtful assessment of Clark&#x2019;s place in Western writing. In these pages, Clark lives again, a warm, complex, and ultimately anguished human being. Benson&#x2019;s remarkably astute and sensitive biography is destined to be the book that readers and researchers consult first for information about this major western writer.</p></p><p>Jackson J.

Jeff lives with his wife and two sons in Massachusetts, where they own a bookstore, An Unlikely Story.<br> &nbsp;The main character wants to make one thing clear: this is NOT a diary--it's a journal. And it's his mother's idea for him to chronicle his life as a tortured sixth-grader, not his. One day Greg will be famous, but "for now I'm stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons." In a voice that brings to mind Holden Caulfield and David Sedaris rolled into one, Greg discusses the fleeting nature of popularity, the logic of bullying, and the fickleness of the fairer sex. Narrator Ramon de Ocampo is completely tuned in to Greg's angst-filled point of view. Though Greg is not always what you'd call a sympathetic character, de Ocampo's well-dramatized, insightful presentations of his various plights evoke our empathy--and laughter.

Mackenzie's 1789 journey to the Arctic Ocean and his arduous journey to the Pacific in 1793 predate the Lewis and Clark expedition. By the age of thirty-one Alexander Mackenzie had become the first man to cross North America from the northwestern hub of the interior trade, Lake Athabasca in present-day northern Alberta, to the Pacific Ocean. He had opened the continent to trade and exploration.</p><p>Mackenzie was a man of enormous ego and overpowering ambition. He left Scotland in search of opportunity in the North American fur trade and achieved success through a combination of bold exploits, grim determination, and business acumen. Mackenzie returned to his homeland late in life to be knighted, marry, and live a more genteel life, leaving behind a M�tis family in North America. His celebrated book Voyages from Montreal remains an enduring classic of world travel literature.</p><p>In his research, Barry Gough traveled from Mackenzie's birthplace to his tomb and from Montreal to the Arctic Ocean and to the Pacific. He takes the reader along with Mackenzie on his hazardous travels and voyages, using contemporary accounts to bring to life the problems and perils faced by the young explorer.</p><p>First Across the Continent reveals the international impact of Sir Alexander Mackenzie's expeditions and places him among the elite of New World explorers, illuminating his vital role in the history of the fur trade and the American West.</p><p></p></p><p>The first white man to cross North America, Scottish-born Alexander Mackenzie (1764-1820) was typical of his generation of explorers: this bold adventurer who surveyed the untamed wilderness with impressive accuracy was also a hardheaded businessman who ventured into unknown Canadian territory in search of profits from fur trading. Canadian historian Barry Gough admires Mackenzie's toughness and daring without glossing over the towering ego and knack for self-promotion that won him a knighthood from England in 1802. <i>First Across the Continent</i> is another enjoyable entry in the University of Oklahoma's Western Biographies series.<p><strong>Barry Gough</strong>, Professor of History, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, is the author of a dozen books and many articles on American, British, and Canadian frontiers and exploration, including <em>The Northwest Coast: British Navigation, Trade, and Discoveries to 1812.</em></p></p><h2>The Journal of H�l�ne Berr</h2><p>Ranging from 1942 to her family&#39;s 1944 deportation, the personal journal of the daughter of a prominent Jewish family describes two years of life in war-time Paris under Nazi occupation, writing not only of the harsh realities of being a Jew in Vichy France but also of her love of literature and music, the beauty of Paris, and more.</p><p>Helene Berr was a student of English Literature at the Sorbonne in Paris. She was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 with her mother and father, and she died in Bergen-Belsen in April 1945, just a few weeks before the liberation of the camp.<i>Friday, 10 July <br><br></i>At the library I had nothing to do. I almost finished <i>Eyeless in Gaza</i>. Remarkable. <br><br>Nicole S. came to collect me. <br><br>Mlle Detraux for lunch. <br><br>A new order&#x2019;s been issued today, about the m�tro. In fact, this morning, at �cole Militaire, I was about to get into the front carriage when I suddenly realized that the harsh words of the inspector were addressed to me: &#x201c;You there, in the other carriage.&#x201d; I ran like a hare not to miss the train, and when I got into the last-but-one carriage, tears were pouring from my eyes, tears of rage, and of protest against this brutality. <br><br>In addition, Jews are no longer entitled to cross the Champs-Elys�es. Theatres and restaurants are off limits. The news has been couched in normal and hypocritical terms, as if it was an established fact that Jews are persecuted in France, as if it was a given, accepted as a necessity and a right. <br><br>When I thought about it, I boiled with such rage that I had to come into this bedroom to calm myself down. <br><br>Went to the Charpentier gallery with Nicole and Bernard, who took us back to his place for tea.<br><i>Saturday, 11 July <br><br></i>Music practice. Afterwards, the Pineaus and Fran�oise Masse as well as Legrand were here. Played the &#x201c;Trout&#x201d; Quintet. I wasn&#x2019;t the hostess I wanted to be. Around 6.30 . . . the corset-maker and Mlle Monsaingeon called. When I returned to the lounge, it was too late. Everyone was leaving. The Simons came after dinner.<br><i>Sunday, 12 July <br></i><br>Aubergenville with Mme L�vy.<br><i>Monday, 13 July<br><br></i>Jean Morawiecki at the library. He walked back here with me without waiting for his exam results. . . .<br><i>Wednesday, 15 July, 11.00 p.m. </i><br><br>Something is brewing, something that will be a tragedy, maybe <i>the </i>tragedy. <br><br>M. Simon came round this evening at 10.00 to warn us that he&#x2019;d been told about a round-up for the day after tomorrow, twenty thousand people. I&#x2019;ve learned to associate the man with disasters. <br><br>Day began by reading the new order at the shoe shop, also ended the same way. <br><br>A wave of terror has been gripping everybody else as well these past few days. It appears that the S.S. have taken command in France and that terror must follow. <br><br>Without saying so, everybody disapproves of our staying. But when we broach the subject ourselves, disapproval is expressed in no uncertain terms: yesterday, it was Mme Lyon-Caen; today, Margot, Robert, M. Simon.<br><i>Saturday, 18 July <br><br></i>I am resuming this diary today. On Thursday I thought life might have ground to a halt. But it has gone on. It has resumed. Yesterday evening, after my day at the library, it had returned to such normality that I could hardly believe what had happened the previous day. Since yesterday it has turned again. When I got home just now, Maman announced that there was a great deal of hope for Papa. On the one hand, there&#x2019;s Papa&#x2019;s return. On the other, this departure for the Free Zone. Each of these things brings its own trial. The departure gave me a feeling almost of despair, I can&#x2019;t work out why. I came home geared up for the struggle, united with the good against the bad; I had been to see Mme Bi�der, that poor mother of eight whose husband has been deported; she lives in Faubourg Saint-Denis. Denise and I stayed with her for a quarter of an hour; as we left, I felt almost glad to have plunged myself into real suffering. I definitely felt that I was guilty, that there was something I hadn&#x2019;t been <i>seeing</i>, and that this was reality. This woman&#x2019;s sister who has four children has been taken away. On the evening of the round-up she had gone into hiding, but fate had her come back down to see the concierge just when the policeman was coming to get her. Mme Bi�der is like a hunted animal. She&#x2019;s not afraid for herself. But she&#x2019;s afraid they&#x2019;ll take her children away. Some of the children they took had to be dragged along the floor. In Montmartre there were so many arrests that the streets were jammed. Faubourg Saint-Denis has nearly been emptied. Mothers have been separated from their children. <br><br>I&#x2019;m noting the facts, in haste, so as not to forget them, because we <i>must not </i>forget.<br><br>In Mlle Monsaingeon&#x2019;s neighbourhood, a whole family, the father, the mother and five children, gassed themselves to escape the round-up. <br><br>One woman threw herself out of a window. <br><br>Apparently several policeman have been shot for warning people so they could escape. They were threatened with the concentration camp if they failed to obey. Who is going to feed the internees at Drancy now their wives have been arrested? The kids will never find their parents again. What are the longer-term consequences of what happened at dawn the day before yesterday? <br><br>Margot&#x2019;s cousin, who left last week, and we knew she hadn&#x2019;t succeeded in her attempt, was caught at the demarcation line and thrown into jail after they&#x2019;d interrogated her eleven-year-old son for hours to get him to confess that she was Jewish; she has diabetes, and four days later she was dead. It&#x2019;s over. The prison matron had her moved to a hospital when she went into a coma, but it was too late. <br><br>On the m�tro I met Mme Baur, looking as gorgeous as ever. But she was worn out. She did not recognize me straight away. She seemed amazed that we were still there. I always want to be proud when responding to that. She told me we would have lots to do at the U.G.I.F. She didn&#x2019;t hide the fact that it would soon be the turn of women who were French citizens. When she mentioned Odile, it seemed like something very far away. <br><br>But if we have to leave, to leave and abandon struggle and heroism in exchange for dullness and despondency &#x2014; no, I&#x2019;ll do something. The common people are admirable. Apparently quite a lot of factory girls lived with Jews. They are all coming forward to request permission to marry to save their men from deportation.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Triggering Town: Lectures and Essays on Poetry and Writing</h2><p>Title: The Triggering Town( Lectures and Essays on Poetry and Writing) &lt;&gt;Binding: Paperback &lt;&gt;Author: RichardHugo &lt;&gt;Publisher: W.W.Norton&amp;Company</p><p>Richard Hugo's <i>The Triggering Town</i>, originally published in 1979, remains one of the freshest and most refreshing treatises on the writing of poetry. While you won't find formality or nicety here, Hugo has the unusual quality of being highly opinionated and yet not at all convinced that what works for him will work for you. Hugo doesn't believe that he can teach you how to write; he believes he can teach you how he writes, and by doing so, teach you "how to teach yourself how to write." And while most writing instructors claim that one can't be a good writer without being a good reader, Hugo claims "that one learns to write only by writing." Hugo's essays are strong-willed and funny and by turns full of bluster and cloaked in modesty. While "a good teacher can save a young poet years by simply telling him things he need not waste time on, like trying to will originality or trying to share an experience in language or trying to remain true to the facts," he writes, "ultimately the most important things a poet will learn about writing are from himself in the process." Above all, Hugo stresses that creative writing is creative because it is a creative act: "if one is writing the way one should, one does not know what will be on the page until it is there." So, he warns, "If you want to communicate, use the telephone." And "Think small.... If you can't think small, try philosophy or social criticism."Richard Hugo was for many years the director of the creative writing program at the University of Montana, Missoula Campus. He received the Theodore Roethke Memorial Prize and was twice nominated for the National Book Award.</p><h2>The School at Thrush Green (Thrush Green Series #4)</h2><p>For many years, Dorothy Watson and Agnes Fogerty have taught in the school at Thrush Green, and when the time comes for their retirement there is general regret. Who will take Miss Watson&#39;s place as head teacher? As for replacing little Miss Fogerty, it seems impossible to imagine.</p><p><p><b>Miss Read</b> (1913-2012) was the pseudonym of Mrs. Dora Saint, a former schoolteacher beloved for her novels of English rural life, especially those set in the fictional villages of Thrush Green and Fairacre. The first of these, <i>Village School</i>, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature.&nbsp;</p>Miss Read brings us another work about the daily activities of the inhabitants of Thrush Green, a cozy town in rural England. Gwen Watford, whose lyrical voice holds an appropriate English tone, is soft spoken but firm in her delivery. The story focuses primarily on Dorothy Watson and Agnes Fogerty, teachers who have announced they will retire at the end of the school year. Amid the loving gossip and speculation of the community, they look for a new house, learn how to drive a car, and add an abandoned tabby cat to their household. Watford's delightful portrayal of characters enhances this enjoyable journey to the country.

It was the forty-fifth month of World War II, and by the end of May the Germans were forced to acknowledge defeat and recall almost all of their remaining U-boats from the major traffic lanes of the North Atlantic. At U-Boat Headquarters in Berlin, despondent naval officers spoke of "Black May." It was a defeat from which the German U-boat fleet never recovered. <p> <em>Black May</em> is a triumph of scholarship and narrative, an important work of history, and a great sea story. Acclaimed historian Michael Gannon, author of <em>Operation Drumbeat, </em> has done enormous research and produced the most thoroughly documented study ever done of these battles. In his compelling historical saga, the people are as significant as the technical information. </p><p> Given the strategic importance of the events of May 1943, it is natural to ask, How did Black May happen and why? Who or what was responsible? Were new Allied tactics adopted or new weapons employed? </p><p> This book answers those questions and many others. Drawing on original documents in German, British, U.S., and Canadian archives, as well as interviews with surviving participants, Gannon describes the exciting sea and air battles, frequently taking the reader inside the U-boats themselves, aboard British warships, onto the decks of torpedoed merchant ships, and into the cockpits of British and U.S. aircraft. </p><p> Throughout, Gannon tells the Black May story from both the German and Allied perspectives, often using the actual words of captains and crews. Finally, he allows the reader to "listen in" on secretly recorded conversations of captured U-boat men in POW quarters during that same incredible month, giving intimate and moving access to the thoughts and emotions of seamen that is unparalleled in naval literature. Rarely, if ever, has the U-boat war been presented so accurately, so graphically, and so personally as in <em>Black May.</em></p></p><p>After a year of terrorizing ships off the coast of the United States, the tide turned against the U-boats in May 1943 when Allied forces sank 41 vessels and damaged 37 others. This frenzy of activity essentially reopened the North Atlantic to merchant shipping and helped clear a path for the Allies' final assault on Europe the following year. Michael Gannon tells his story with wonderful anecdotes from all perspectives--in one scene, he describes a surfaced U-boat crew standing on deck and watching automobile headlights shine through the blackness of night from the New Jersey shore. Few people realize that German naval vessels actually came so close to the United States, but they did--until, as Gannon tells the story, they were finally pushed away, once and for all, in a single hectic month of combat. Although <i>Black May</i> is something of a sequel to Gannon's extraordinary <i>Operation Drumbeat</i>, which described the German's initial successes, it stands on its own as a brilliant work of naval history. <i>--John J. Miller</i>For two years the German U-boats--the most powerful underwater force ever assembled--turned the seas of the Atlantic into a killing field. Now it was May 1943. The year the Allies struck back. The year the tide of war turned forever.<p> In one extraordinary month, using new tactics, new weapons, and the coordinated forces of a new generation of submarine hunters, the Allies destroyed 41 U-boats and damaged 37 others in the North Atlantic--sending the Nazi U-boat wolf pack running. Here, distinguished naval historian Michael Gannon captures this epic battle and those who shaped it, from the men who made key command decisions to the sailors trapped inside the steel-hulled U-boats as they were pounded by Allied depth charges. Drawing on never-before-released transcripts of secretly recorded conversations of U-boat POWs, this is the epic story of two powerful enemies going head-to-head in a desperate naval battle, and why one side emerged the victor and the other the vanquished.</p></p><h2>Turner and the Elements</h2><p><p></p>A painter of the elements, J. M. W. Turner depicted in his landscapes natural forces such as wind, fire, and water with an emphasis on their considerable destructive power and man&#x2019;s raw vulnerability in the face of it. And be they storm scenes, avalanches, or disasters at sea, Turner&#x2019;s oil paintings and watercolors were also informed by contemporary research in the natural sciences.&nbsp;Conceived by the Bucerius Kunst Forum in Hamburg and edited by leading Turner experts, this volume comprises eighty-five masterpieces from the Tate Gallery in London that are also scheduled for the National Museum in Krakow and the UK&#x2019;s newly opened Turner Contemporary. The works presented here exemplify Turner&#x2019;s extensive knowledge of nature and the impact of its forces, garnered from a lifelong fascination, and show that important developments in the artist&#x2019;s technique over the course of several decades mirrored the many new scientific insights of the time. Especially significant is Turner&#x2019;s stunningly realistic depiction of light, which made many of his canvases seem to actually glow.&nbsp;With 150 lush, full-color illustrations, this volume shows how Turner&#x2019;s ever-deepening understanding of the natural world&#x2014;and of light in particular&#x2014;earned him his place in the pantheon of great European artists.<p></p></p><p><p></p><b>Ortrud Westheider </b>is director of the Bucerius Kunst Forum, an exhibit hall in Hamburg, where <b>Michael Philipp</b> is curator.<p></p></p><h2>Jean-Paul Sartre: A Life (Lives of the Left)</h2><p>From a description of Sartre&#39;s hitherto unknown father to the painful last moments of Sartre&#39;s declining years, this intimate portrait incorporates previously untold aspects of Sartre&#39;s private, political, and literary life, in a new edition of the acclaimed biography, honoring the centennial of Sartre&#39;s birth.

Why do ancient species often remain stable in the fossil record for millions of years and then suddenly disappear? In a world where nice guys often finish last, why do humans value trust and cooperation? At first glance these questions don't appear to have anything in common, but in fact every one of these statements refers to a complex system. The science of complexity studies how single elements, such as a species or a stock, spontaneously organize into complicated structures like ecosystems and economies; stars become galaxies, and snowflakes avalanches almost as if these systems were obeying a hidden yearning for order. <br> Drawing from diverse fields, scientific luminaries such as Nobel Laureates Murray Gell-Mann and Kenneth Arrow are studying complexity at a think tank called The Santa Fe Institute. The revolutionary new discoveries researchers have made there could change the face of every science from biology to cosmology to economics. M. Mitchell Waldrop's groundbreaking bestseller takes readers into the hearts and minds of these scientists to tell the story behind this scientific revolution as it unfolds.</p><p><b>M. Mitchell Waldrop</b> has his doctorate in elementary particle physics and is the author of <i>Man-Made Minds.</i> He spent ten years as a senior writer for <i>Science</i> magazine, where he is now a contributing correspondent.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b><i>The Irish Idea of a Hero</i></b><br><br>Sitting alone at his table by the bar, Brian Arthur stared out the front window of the tavern and did his best to ignore the young urban professionals drifting in to get an early start on Happy Hour. Outside, in the concrete canyons of the financial district, the typical San Francisco fog was turning into a typical San Francisco drizzle. That was fine by him. On this late afternoon of March 17, 1987, he wasn't in the mood to be impressed with brass fittings, ferns, and stained glass. He wasn't in a mood to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. And he most definitely wasn't in a mood to carouse with ersatz Irishmen wearing bits of green on their pinstripes. He just wanted to silently sip his beer in frustrated rage. Stanford University Professor William Brian Arthur, native son of Belfast, Northern Ireland, was at rock bottom.<br><br>And the day had started so well.<br><br>That was the irony of it all. When he'd set out for Berkeley that morning, he'd actually been looking forward to the trip as a kind of triumphal reunion: local boy makes good. He'd really loved his years in Berkeley, back in the early 1970s. Perched on the hillsides north of Oakland, just across the bay from San Francisco, it was a pushy, vital, alive kind of place full of ethnics and street people and outrageous ideas. Berkeley was where he'd gotten his Ph. D. from the University of California, where he'd met and married a tall blonde doctoral student in statistics named Susan Peterson, where he'd spent his first "postdoc" year in the economics department. Berkeley, of all the places he'd lived and worked ever since, was the place he wanted to come home to.<br><br>Well now he <i>was</i> coming home, sort of. The event itself wouldn't be a big deal: just lunch with the chairman of the Berkeley economics department and one of his former professors there. But it was the first time he'd come back to his old department in years, and certainly the first time he'd ever done so feeling like an academic equal. He was coming back with twelve years of experience working all over the globe and a major reputation as a scholar of human fertility in the Third World. He was coming back as the occupant of an endowed chair of economics at Stanford -- the sort of thing that rarely gets handed out to anyone under age fifty. At age forty-one, Arthur was coming back as someone who had made it in academia. And who knew? The folks at Berkeley might even start talking about a lob offer.<br><br>Oh yes, he'd really been high on himself that morning. So why hadn't he, years ago, just stuck to the mainstream instead of trying to invent a whole new approach to economics? Why hadn't he played it safe instead of trying to get in step with some nebulous, half-imaginary scientific revolution?<br><br>Because he couldn't get it out of his head, that's why. Because he could see it almost everywhere he looked. The scientists barely seemed to recognize it themselves, most of the time. But after three hundred years of dissecting everything into molecules and atoms and nuclei and quarks, they finally seemed to be turning that process inside out. Instead of looking for the simplest pieces possible, they were starting to look at how those pieces go together into complex wholes.<br><br>He could see it happening in biology, where people had spent the past twenty years laying bare the molecular mechanisms of DNA, and proteins, and all the other components of the cell. Now they were also beginning to grapple with the essential mystery: how can several quadrillion such molecules organize themselves into an entity that moves, that responds, that reproduces, that is <i>alive?</i><br><br>He could see it happening in the brain sciences, where neuroscientists, psychologists, computer scientists, and artificial intelligence researchers were struggling to comprehend the essence of mind: How do those billions of densely interconnected nerve cells inside our skulls give rise to feeling, thought, purpose, and awareness?<br><br>He could even see it happening in physics, where the physicists were still trying to come to terms with the mathematical theory of chaos, the intricate beauty of fractals, and the weird inner workings of solids and liquids. There was profound mystery here: Why is it that simple particles obeying simple rules will sometimes engage in the most astonishing, unpredictable behavior? And why is it that simple particles will spontaneously organize themselves into complex structures like stars, galaxies, snowflakes, and hurricanes -- almost as if they were obeying a hidden yearning for organization and order?<br><br>The signs were everywhere. Arthur couldn't quite put the feeling into words. Nobody could, so far as he could tell. But somehow, he could sense that all these questions were really the <i>same</i> question. Somehow, the old categories of science were beginning to dissolve. Somehow, a new, unified science was out there waiting to be born. It would be a rigorous science, Arthur was convinced, just as "hard" as physics ever was, and just as thoroughly grounded in natural law. But instead of being a quest for the ultimate particles, it would be about flux, change, and the forming and dissolving of patterns. Instead of ignoring everything that wasn't uniform and predictable, it would have a place for individuality and the accidents of history. Instead of being about simplicity, it would be about -- well, complexity.<br><br>And that was precisely where Arthur's new economics came in. Conventional economics, the kind he'd been taught in school, was about as far from this vision of complexity as you could imagine. Theoretical economists endlessly talked about the stability of the marketplace, and the balance of supply and demand. They transcribed the concept into mathematical equations and proved theorems about it. They accepted the gospel according to Adam Smith as the foundation for a kind of state religion. But when it came to instability and change in the economy -- well, they seemed to find the very idea disturbing, something they'd just as soon not talk about.<br><br>But Arthur had embraced instability. Look out the window, he'd told his colleagues. Like it or not, the marketplace isn't stable. The <i>world</i> isn't stable. It's full of evolution, upheaval, and surprise. Economics had to take that ferment into account. And now he believed he'd found the way to do that, using a principle known as "increasing returns" -- or in the King James translation, "To them that hath shall be given." Why had high-tech companies scrambled to locate in the Silicon Valley area around Stanford instead of in Ann Arbor or Berkeley? Because a lot of older high-tech companies were already there. Them that has gets. Why did the VHS video system run away with the market, even though Beta was technically a little bit better? Because a few more people happened to buy VHS systems early on, which led to more VHS movies in the video stores, which led to still more people buying VHS players, and so on. Them that has gets.<br><br>The examples could be multiplied endlessly. Arthur had convinced himself that increasing returns pointed the way to the future for economics, a future in which he and his colleagues would work alongside the physicists and the biologists to understand the messiness, the upheaval, and the spontaneous self-organization of the world. He'd convinced himself that increasing returns could be the foundation for a new and very different kind of economic science.<br><br>Unfortunately, however, he hadn't had much luck convincing anybody else. Outside of his immediate circle at Stanford, most economists thought his ideas were -- strange. Journal editors were telling him that this increasing-returns stuff "wasn't economics." In seminars, a good fraction of the audience reacted with outrage: how <i>dare</i> he suggest that the economy was not in equilibrium! Arthur found the vehemence baffling. But clearly he needed allies, people who could open their minds and hear what he was trying to tell them. And that, as much as any desire for a homecoming, was the reason he'd gone to Berkeley.<br><br>So there they had all been, sitting down to sandwiches at the faculty club. Tom Rothenberg, one of his former professors, had asked the inevitable question: "So, Brian, what are you working on these days?" Arthur had given him the two-word answer just to get started: "Increasing returns." And the economics department chairman, Al Fishlow, had stared at him with a kind of deadpan look.<br><br>"But -- we know increasing returns don't exist."<br><br>"Besides," jumped in Rothenberg with a grin, "if they did, we'd have to outlaw them!"<br><br>And then they'd laughed. Not unkindly. It was just an insider's joke. Arthur <i>knew</i> it was a joke. It was trivial. Yet that one sound had somehow shattered his whole bubble of anticipation. He'd sat there, struck speechless. Here were two of the economists he respected most, and they just -- couldn't listen. Suddenly Arthur had felt naive. Stupid. Like someone who didn't know enough <i>not</i> to believe in increasing returns. Somehow, it had been the last straw.<br><br>He'd barely paid attention during the rest of the lunch. After it was over and everyone had said their polite good-byes, he'd climbed into his faded old Volvo and driven back over the Bay Bridge into San Francisco. He'd taken the first exit he could, onto the Embarcadero. He'd stopped at the first bar he found. And he'd come in here to sit amidst the ferns and to give some serious thought to getting out of economics entirely.<br><br>Somewhere around the bottom of his second beer, Arthur realized that the place was beginning to get seriously noisy. The yuppies were arriving in force to celebrate the patron saint of Ireland. Well, maybe it was time to go home. This certainly wasn't accomplishing anything. He got up and walked out to his car; the foggy drizzle was still coming down.<br><br>Home was in Palo Alto, thirty-five miles south of the city in the suburban flats around Stanford. It was sunset when he finally pulled into the driveway. He must have made some noise. His wife, Susan, opened the front door and watched him as he was walking across the lawn: a slim, prematurely gray man who doubtless looked about as fed up and bedraggled as he felt.<br><br>"Well," she said, standing there in the doorway, "how did it go in Berkeley? Did they like your ideas?"<br><br>"It was the pits," said Arthur. "Nobody there believes in increasing returns."<br><br>Susan Arthur had seen her husband returning from the academic wars before. "Well," she said, trying to find something comforting to say, "I guess it wouldn't be a revolution, would it, if everybody believed in it at the start?"<br><br>Arthur looked at her, struck speechless for the second time that day. And then he just couldn't help it. He started to laugh.<br><br><b>The Education of a Scientist</b><br><br>When you're growing up Catholic in Belfast, says Brian Arthur, speaking in the soft, high cadences of that city, a certain rebelliousness sets in naturally. It wasn't that he ever felt oppressed, exactly. His father was a bank manager and his family was solidly middle class. The only sectarian incident that ever involved him personally came one afternoon as he was walking home in his parochial school uniform: a bunch of Protestant boys started pelting him with bits of brick and stone, and one piece of brick hit him in the forehead. (He could hardly see for the blood pouring into his eyes -- but he damn well threw that brick back.) Nor did he really feel that the Protestants were devils; his mother was a Protestant who converted to Catholicism when she married. He never even felt especially political. He tended to be much more interested in ideas and philosophy.<br><br>No, the rebelliousness is just something you pick up from the air. "The culture doesn't equip you to lead, but to undermine," he says. Look at whom the Irish admire: Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet, Daniel O'Connell, Padraic Pearse. "All the Irish heroes were revolutionaries. The highest peak of heroism is to lead an absolutely <i>hopeless</i> revolution, and then give the greatest speech of your life from the dock -- the night before you're hanged.<br><br>"In Ireland," he says, "an appeal to authority <i>never</i> works."<br><br>In an odd sort of way, Arthur adds, that streak of Irish rebelliousness is what got him started in his own academic career. Catholic Belfast tended to be rather contemptuous of intellectuals. So, of course, he became one. In fact, he can remember wanting to be a "scientist" as early as age four, long before he knew what a scientist was. The idea just seemed deliciously exotic and mysterious. And yet, having gotten that idea in his head, young Brian was nothing if not determined. At school he plunged into engineering and physics and hard-edged mathematics as soon as he could. And in 1966 he had taken first-class honors in electrical engineering at Queen's University in Belfast. "Oh, I suppose you'll end up a wee professor somewhere," said his mother, who was in fact very proud; no one in her generation of the family had ever even attended a university.<br><br>Later in 1966 that same determination had led him across the Irish Sea to England and the University of Lancaster, where he started graduate studies in a highly mathematical form of engineering known as operations research -- basically, a set of techniques for calculating such things as how to organize a factory to get the most output for the least input, or how to keep a fighter jet under control when it is buffeted by unexpected forces. "At the time, British industry was in terrible shape," says Arthur. "I thought that maybe through science we could reorganize it and sort it out."<br><br>And in 1967, after the professors at Lancaster had proved insufferably stuffy and condescending -- "Well," says Arthur, doing his best imitation of bored British snobbery, "it's nice to have an Irishman in the department; it adds a little colour" -- he left for America and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. "From the moment I set foot here, I felt right at home," he says. "This was the sixties. The people were open, the culture was open, the scientific education was second to none. In the United States, anything seemed possible."<br><br>The one thing that wasn't possible in Ann Arbor, unfortunately, was ready access to the mountains and the sea, both of which Arthur loved. So he arranged to finish his Ph.D. work at Berkeley starting in the fall of 1969. And to support himself in the summer beforehand he applied for a job with McKinsey and Company, one of the top management consulting companies in the world.<br><br>That was a piece of incredibly good fortune. Arthur didn't realize until later just how lucky he was; people were clamoring to be hired at McKinsey. But it turned out that the company liked his operations research background and the fact that he knew German. They needed someone to work out of the D�sseldorf office. Was he interested?<br><br>Was he? Arthur had the time of his life. The last time he'd been in Germany he'd worked at a blue-collar summer job at 75 cents an hour. Now here he was, twenty-three years old, advising the board of directors of BASF on what to do with an oil and gas division or a fertilizer division worth hundreds of millions of dollars. "I learned that operating at the top was just as easy as operating at the bottom," he laughs.<br><br>But it was more than just an ego trip. Basically, McKinsey was selling modern American management techniques (a concept that didn't sound as funny in 1969 as it would have fifteen years later). "Companies in Europe at that time typically had hundreds of subdivisions," he says. "They didn't even know what they owned." Arthur discovered that he had a real taste for wading into mess...</p><h2>The Sundered Arms: Bk. 8 (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</h2><p>Evil once again stalks the land as Andaron's Delve, a once-powerful dwarven stronghold ravaged by war, is seized by goblins and monstrous beasts who take over the abandoned mountain, in a new adventure based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game.

The squalid and turbulent prisons of London were overflowing, and crime was on the rise. Even the hulks sifting at anchor in the Thames were packed with malcontent criminals and petty thieves. So the English government decided to undertake the unprecedented move of shipping off its convicts to a largely unexplored landmass at the other end of the world.<br><br>Using the personal journals and documents that were kept during this expedition, historian/novelist Thomas Keneally re-creates the grueling overseas voyage, a hellish, suffocating journey that claimed the lives of many convicts. Miraculously, the fleet reached the shores of what was then called New South Wales in 1788, and after much trial and error, the crew managed to set up a rudimentary yet vibrant settlement. As governor of the colony, Phillip took on the challenges of dealing with unruly convicts, disgruntled officers, a bewildered, sometimes hostile native population, as well as such serious matters as food shortages and disease. Moving beyond Phillip, Keneally offers captivating portrayals of Aborigines, who both aided and opposed Phillip, and of the settlers, including convicts who were determined to overcome their pasts and begin anew.<br><br>With the authority of a renowned historian and the narrative grace of a brilliant novelist, Thomas Keneally offers an insider&#x2019;s perspective into the dramatic saga of the birth of a vibrant society in an unfamiliar land. <i>A Commonwealth of Thieves</i> immerses us in the fledgling penal colony and conjures up colorful scenes of the joy and heartbreak, the thrills and hardships that characterized those first four improbable years.

This was many times more than the number that had ever been seen here, in a sea so huge and vacant that in today&#x2019;s conventional atlases no one map represents it. The people on the eleven ships were lost to the world. They had celebrated their New Year at 44 degrees South latitude with &#x201c;hard salt beef and a few musty pancakes.&#x201d; Their passage was in waters turbulent with gales, roiling from an awful collision between melted ice from the Antarctic coast and warm currents from the Indian Ocean behind them, and the Pacific ahead. High and irregular seas broke over the decks continuously, knocking the cattle in their pens off their legs. The travelers knew they were past the rocks of sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Island and were reaching for the dangerous southern capes of Van Diemen&#x2019;s Land, which they intended to round on their way to their destination.<br><br>What would have intrigued the divine eye was the number of vessels&#x2013;though they travelled in two sections, each division separated from the other by a few hundred miles. So far in the history of Europe, only six ships had come into this area named the Southern Ocean, which lay between the uncharted south coast of New Holland (later to be known as Australia) and Antarctica&#x2019;s massive ice pack. In 1642, a Dutchman, Abel Tasman, a vigorous captain of the Dutch East India Company, had crossed this stretch to discover the island he would name Van Diemen&#x2019;s Land after his Viceroy in Batavia (now Jakarta), but which would in the end be named Tasmania to honour him.<br><br>His ships, a high-sterned, long-bowed yacht named <i>Heemskerck </i>and a round-sterned vessel of the variety called a flute, the <i>Zeehaean, </i>were of such minuscule tonnage as to be overshadowed by HMS <i>Resolution </i>and HMS <i>Adventure</i>&#x2019;s roughly 400 ton each. These last two, still tiny vessels by modern standards, less than one-third a football field in length, came through the Southern Ocean in 1774 under the overall command of the Yorkshireman James Cook. The <i>Resolution </i>travelled well to the south near the Antarctic ice mass, and rendezvoused with <i>Adventure </i>at the islands Tasman had named New Zealand. Then in 1776, the <i>Resolution </i>and the HMS <i>Discovery, </i>again under Cook, could have been seen in these waters. And that was all.<br><br>What were these eleven ships that in 1788 followed the path of Cook and Tasman to the southern capes of Van Diemen&#x2019;s Land? One might expect them to be full of Georgian conquistadors, or a task force of scientists to suit the enlightened age. If not that, then they must have carried robust dissenters from the political or religious establishment of their day.<br><br>The startling fact was they carried prisoners, and the guardians of prisoners. They were the degraded of Britain&#x2019;s overstretched penal system, and the obscure guardians of the degraded. Any concepts of commerce and science on these ships were secondary to the ordained penal purpose. Few aboard had commercial capacities, though a number of the gentlemen were part-time scientists. Their destination was to be not a home of the chosen, or even a chosen home, but a place imposed by authority and devised specifically with its remoteness in mind. The chief order of business for all of them, prisoners and guardians, was to apply themselves to a unique penal experiment.<br><br>The merchant ships of the fleet were to return to Britain after discharging their felons, picking up cargoes of cotton and tea in China and India on the return journey. But because this outward cargo was debased, some in Britain expected never to hear again from the fleet&#x2019;s passengers. It was believed they would become a cannibal kingdom on the coast they were bound for, and&#x2013;one way or another&#x2013;devour each other.<br>The idea of expelling convicts to distant places was not new. It had occurred to European powers from the fifteenth century onwards, once they began acquiring huge and distant spaces in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. As a policy, it could solve many problems at the one time, including the problem which in modern days would be designated NIMBY, Not In My Backyard. But the chief difference of opinion soon emerged. As early as 1584, Hakluyt&#x2019;s <i>Discourse for Western Planting </i>proposed that &#x201c;sturdy vagabonds&#x201d; should be sent away to the colonies so that &#x201c;the fry of the wandering beggars of England that grow up idly and burden us to this realm may there be unladen, better bred up, and may people waste countries.&#x201d; Francis Bacon, however, debated the wisdom of unloading miscreants on far-off dominions in his essay <i>Of Plantations. </i>&#x201c;It is a shameful and unblessed thing, to take the scum of people, and wicked and condemned men, to be the people with whom you plant.&#x201d;<br><br>In reality, Hakluyt would win the debate with Bacon. It <i>was </i>&#x201c;the scum of people, and wicked and condemned men&#x201d;&#x2013;and women&#x2013;who made up the cargo of the criminal transports found in the Southern Ocean in the New Year of 1788. It would not have consoled the condemned on those wind-tossed mornings as they stirred and complained in their 18 inches of space on the convict decks that, uniquely placed as they were, they were also part of a long European tradition of transporting the unfortunate and the fallen, beginning with Cromwell&#x2019;s transportation of many Irish peasants, sent as labour to the plantations of the West Indies, and progressing to the 1656 order of the Council of State that lewd and dangerous persons should be hunted down &#x201c;for transporting them to the English plantations in America.&#x201d;<br><br>In Britain, colonial penal arrangements were recourses governments thought of regularly. When prisoners were landed in the American colonies throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, settlers would buy a prisoner&#x2019;s labour&#x2013;generally for seven years&#x2013;at the auction block. The master took over the prisoner and troubled the authorities only in the case of escape or major unruliness. Between 1650 and 1775, some tens of thousands of prisoners were sent on these terms to America, perhaps as many as 120,000. Sometimes vagrants and the poor&#x2013;&#x201c;idle person lurking in parts of London&#x201d;&#x2013;would voluntarily let themselves be transported and sold with the criminals.<br><br>The trade in convict or indentured servants was attractive to the British government because, unlike the prison system, it cost them little. Merchants would transport them cheaply, sometimes for nothing, in return for what could be earned through selling the convicts&#x2019; labour. In fact, merchants often found this trade in white servants cheaper than that in African slaves. Between 1729 and 1745 the two chief contractors in London sent to America an average of 280 prisoners a year each, up towards 600 a year in total. Based on auction prices in Baltimore between 1767 and 1775, a convict&#x2019;s labour cost between �10 and �25, and it was possible for an affluent convict to bid for himself and do his time as, effectively, a free agent. But very few transported convicts could afford to buy their own labour or return home from Virginia, Maryland, or Georgia, even if they survived the &#x201c;seasoning period,&#x201d; the first few years of malaria and other diseases which killed two out of five inhabitants of Virginia; and so the convict engaged in field labour was likely to find an early grave in American soil.<br><br>In extolling the benefits of transportation for the home nation, the British government gave little attention to the impact it had on the region that received the felons. One North American colonist was left to complain that &#x201c;America has been made the very common sewer and dung yard to Britain.&#x201d; &#x201c;Very surprising, one would think,&#x201d; wrote another American colonist in 1756, &#x201c;that thieves, burglars, pickpockets and cutpurses, and a herd of the most flagitious banditti upon earth, should be sent as agreeable companions to us!&#x201d; Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, was faced with the same problem of postcolonial denial as later generations of Australians, and wrote unreliably that he did not think the entire number of convicts sent out to the American colonies would amount to 2,000, and &#x201c;being principally men eaten up with disease, they married seldom and propagated little.&#x201d;<br>The men and women surviving on flapjacks and desiccated salted beef and pease&#x2013;a porridge of compacted peas&#x2013;in the great Southern Ocean convict flotilla in 1788 owed their location to the pressure on British prison populations. A new Transportation Act in 1780 had sought to make transportation more obligatory than it had been up to that point.<br><br>The offences for which a prisoner could be transported under the accumulated Transportation Acts of Britain made up an exotic catalogue. Quakers could be transported for denying any oath to be lawful, or assembling themselves together under pretence of joining in religious worship. Notorious thieves and takers of spoil in the borderlands of Northumberland and Cumberland, commonly called &#x201c;moss-troopers&#x201d; and &#x201c;reivers,&#x201d; were also subject to transportation; similarly, persons found guilty of stealing cloth from the rack, or embezzling His Majesty&#x2019;s stores to the value of twenty shillings; persons convicted of wilfully burning ricks of corn, hay, or barns in the nighttime (crimes generally associated with peasant protest against a landlord); persons convicted of larceny and other offences; persons imprisoned for exporting wool and not paying the excise on it; persons convicted of entering into any park and killi...</p><h2>Humanists and Reformers: A History of the Renaissance and Reformation</h2><p>Humanists and Reformers portrays in a single, expansive volume two great traditions in human history: the Italian Renaissance and the age of the Reformation. Bard Thompson provides a fascinating survey of these important historical periods under pressure of their own cultural, social, and spiritual experiences, exploring the bonds that held Humanists and Reformers together and the estrangements that drove them apart.<br>In the section of the book devoted to the Italian Renaissance, an opening historiography is followed by accounts of the struggles that underlay the Renaissance, the Renaissance papacy and the rebuilding of Rome, the growth of capitalism, and the rise of the monarchies and the city states. Separate histories of Venice, Milan, and Florence are provided, with special attention given to the Florentine humanists. Painters, sculptors, and architects of the Quattrocento and Cinquecento are also given full scope, including close-ups of Michelangelo and Raphael. Finally, the decline of the Renaissance in Italy is discussed as well as the voyages of discovery.<br>The section devoted to the age of the Reformation includes detailed coverage of Erasmus and the major figures of the Northern Renaissance. It also extensively covers the Reformers and their thought: Luther, Zwingli, the Anabaptists and the left wing of the Reformation, Calvin, and the Counter-Reformation. The complex history of the Tudors to 1558 and the reign of Elizabeth I occupy the last large sections of the book.<br>Throughout this volume Thompson gives special attention to subjects of note from both periods in engaging excursuses: Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, the emergence of printing, Andrea Mantegna, Titian and the Venetian painters, Leonardo da Vinci, Giannozzo Manetti, Benozzo Gozzoli's Procession of the Magi, Raphael's Vatican Stanze, Michelangelo's Medici tombs, art and poetry in early sixteenth-century France, Zwingli's thought, St. Peter's Basilica, and Foxe's Book of Martyrs.</p><p>Bard Thompson (1925-1987) was professor emeritus of church history at Drew University and dean emeritus of the Drew Graduate School in Madison, New Jersey.</p><h2>By National Fire Protection Association NFPA 99: Health Care Facilities Code, 2015 Edition [Paperback]</h2><p>Building on its successful risk-based approach, the 2015 edition of NFPA 99: Health Care Facilities Code improves usability for better health care safety. The 2015 edition NFPA 99: Health Care Facilities Code provides performance criteria for health care facilities that builds on the risk-based approach introduced in the 2012 NFPA 99, where it is the risk posed to patients and staff, not the type of building, that defines safety guidelines. Provisions govern installation, inspection, testing, maintenance, performance, and safe practices for facilities, material, equipment, and appliances -- including medical gas and vacuum systems formerly found in NFPA 99C. Major changes in the 2015 NFPA 99 make performance criteria more usable, enforceable, and adoptable. Other revisions respond to new information and the evolving industry. Keep health care facilities up-to-code and patients and staff safe. The 2015 NFPA 99 is a must-have resource for everyone involved in health care safety including contractors, engineers, facility managers, AHJs, plumbers, gas and vacuum system installers, security personnel, insurance companies, and manufacturers.

Contemporary politics is inextricably intertwined with it, from conflict in the Middle East to the claim by many in the United States that a return to &#34;biblical values&#34; is warranted. It influenced the Pilgrims to leave England in the 17th century; it inspired the founders of the new republic in the 18th; it roused both slaves and abolitionists to seek a new Moses and sponsor a new Exodus in the 19th and the Jews to establish a homeland in the 20th. Professor Levine&#39;s commentary thoughtfully explores selected passages from the texts called the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible, and the Tanakh. She provides clear examples of how various approaches to biblical research and interpretation can enrich your understanding of this inexhaustibly fruitful and powerful text. Of course, 24 lectures cannot hope to cover the Old Testament in its entirety. The method of the course is to discuss especially interesting or prominent passages from a cross-section of all the genres the Old Testament contains, using each passage as an example of how to apply a particular method of interpretation to the Bible. Even if you know the Old Testament well, you will find it enlightening to hear Professor Levine discuss how it appears against the larger background of the ancient Near East as revealed by research in archaeology, cross-cultural studies, and comparative religion.</p><p></p><h2>Autumn Brides: A Year of Weddings Novella Collection</h2><p><p><strong>Happily ever after begins today.

Who decides, and how? � If they'll use pay phones, why not have a phone in the house? � Why will they use electronic calculators but not computers?</p><p>The Amish are one of America's most intriguing and puzzling communities. To the outsider, their habits and customs abound with contradictions. But the most intriguing puzzle of all is the secret of their survival in the twentieth century.

F. Bishop) of a journey through central China in 1896-1897. The volume focuses on her travels though the province of Szechuan and among the Man-tze of the Somo territory. Many of the areas she explored and carefully described were almost unknown to European visitors and had not been mentioned in any earlier English publications. The volume is based on journal letters and the diary written during her journey, and it is generously illustrated with photographs and Chinese drawings. Bishop&#39;s work was warmly received in England and praised especially for the information included on agriculture and industry. The Geographical Journal heralded the work as &#39;undoubtedly one of the most important contributions to English literature on that country&#39;. It remains a key source for late nineteenth-century British perceptions of China.</p><p></p><h2>From Sheep to Scarf (Start to Finish Book) (English and German Edition)</h2><p>A simply worded text with vivid illustrations shows how wool is processed from fleece to yarn to knitted scarf</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Six Swans</h2><p>Six unfortunate young men were turned into swans by their stepmother.

The original Volume Three (<i>Fighters and Bombers 1935 to 1950</i>) has now been split into separate volumes with this book covering fighters and a new Volume Four in preparation solely devoted to bomber designs. This split has allowed space for the inclusion of much new information and many new photographs.</p><p>This book describes the design and development of the British fighter from the end of the biplane fighter to the start of the jet era.

During this period the art of fighter design took some big and important steps forward and here can be found fixed-gun fighters and turret fighters, in both single and twin-engine form, plus the first generation of jet fighters.

The coverage of the projects and programs begins in the mid-1930s in the knowledge that war was coming, and goes through to some proposals which appeared after the war had ended. During this period the art of fighter design took huge steps forward from fixed-gun and turret fighters, such as the Supermarine Spitfire and Boulton Paul Defiant programs, to the first generation of jet fighters, the studies of which included the Gloster Rocket. In most cases these types were designed specifically to meet the requirements of the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm. As with the companion volumes in the <i>British Secret Projects</i> series, author Tony Buttler has made full use of archive materials, much of it never published before. Three-view drawings, photographs of models and original artist&#x2019;s impressions combine to show how these unbuilt designs would have appeared, and examples new to this volume include the Folland Fo.118 and the Westland P.13. Data and appendices summarize the project, their contracts and specifications as part of a detailed insight into many fascinating aircraft designs. This latest fully revised edition of <i>British Secret Projects 3: Fighters 1935 to 1950</i> provides a wealth of new information and many new photographs for the aviation historian and modeler alike.Tony Buttler was born in England. He joined High Duty Alloys in 1974 as a metallurgist and for nearly 20 years was involved in the testing of aluminum and titanium airframe and engine components for all of the world&#39;s major aircraft. It was during this period that his great interest in aviation began to blossom. After leaving HDA, Buttler earned his Masters Degree in Archives and Library Studies at Loughborough University, and became a freelance aviation historian specializing in the design and development of military aircraft.</p><h2>Electric Bread</h2><p>Warm and savory, aromatic and sensual, no wonder bread has become the health and gourmet food of the &#39;90s!

For her and her brother, Nik, now in their forties, no relationship is more significant. They grew up in Los Angeles in the late seventies and early eighties. Nik was always the artist, always wrote music, always had a band. Now he makes his art in private, obsessively documenting the work, but never testing it in the world. Denise remains Nik&#x2019;s most passionate and acute audience, sometimes his only audience. She is also her family&#x2019;s first defense against the world&#x2019;s fragility. Friends die, their mother&#x2019;s memory and mind unravel, and the news of global catastrophe and individual tragedy haunts Denise. When her daughter, Ada, decides to make a film about Nik, everyone&#x2019;s vulnerabilities seem to escalate. <br><br>Dana Spiotta has established herself as a &#x201c;singularly powerful and provocative writer&#x201d; (<i>The Boston Globe</i>) whose work is fiercely original. <i>Stone Arabia</i>&#x2014;riveting, unnerving, and strangely beautiful&#x2014;reexamines what it means to be an artist and redefines the ties that bind.</p><p>Dana Spiotta is the author of <i>Innocents and Others</i>; <i>Stone Arabia</i>, A National Books Critics Circle Award finalist; and <i>Eat the Document</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award. Spiotta is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Rome Prize for Literature. She lives in Syracuse, New York.She always said it started, or became apparent to her, when their father brought him a guitar for his tenth birthday. At least that was the family legend, repeated and burnished into a shared over-memory. But she did really think it was true: he changed in one identifiable moment. Up until that point, Nik&#x2019;s main occupations had been reading <i>Mad</i> magazine and making elaborate ink drawings of dogs and cats behaving like far-out hipsters. He had characters&#x2014;Mickey the shaggy mutt who smoked weed and rode motorcycles; Linda the sluttish afghan who wore her hair hanging over one eye; and Nik Kat, his little alter ego, a cool cat who played pranks and escaped many close calls. Nik Kat addressed the reader directly and gave little winky comments about not wanting you to turn the page. Denise appeared as Little Kit Kat, the wonder tot. She had a cape and followed all the orders Nik Kat gave her. Nik made a full book out of each episode. He would make three or four copies with carbon paper and then later make more at some expense at the print shop, but each of the covers was created by hand and unique: he drew the images in Magic Marker and then collaged in pieces of colored paper cut from magazines. Denise still had Nik&#x2019;s zines in a box somewhere. He gave one copy to her and Mom (they had to share), one to his girlfriend of the moment (Nik always had a girlfriend), one was put in a plastic sleeve and filed in his fledgling archives, and one went to their father, who lived in San Francisco.<br> <br>Nik would take his father&#x2019;s issue, sign it, and write a limited-edition number on it before taping it into an elaborate package cut from brown paper grocery bags. He would address it to Mr. Richard Kranis. (Always with the word <i>Kronos</i> written next to it in microscopic letters. This alluded to an earlier time when each person in Nik&#x2019;s life was assigned the name and identity of a god. Naturally his dad was Kronos, and even though Nik had long ago moved on from his childish myths-and-gods phase, their father forever retained his Kronos moniker in subtle subscript.) Nik would draw all over the package, making the wrapping paper an extension of the story inside. After he mailed it off to his father, he recorded the edition numbers and who possessed them in his master book. Even then he seemed to be annotating his own life for future reference. &#x201c;Self-curate or disappear,&#x201d; he would say when they were older and Denise began to mock him for his obsessive archiving.<br> <br>Denise didn&#x2019;t think their father ever responded to these packages, but maybe he did. She never asked Nik about it. Her father would send a couple of toys in the mail for their birthdays, but not always, and not every birthday. She remembered him visiting a week after Christmas one year and bringing a carload of presents. He gave Denise a little bike with removable training wheels and sparkly purple handlebar tassels. But the most significant surprise was when he turned up for Nik&#x2019;s tenth birthday.<br> <br>Nik and Denise lived on Vista Del Mar about two blocks from the Hollywood Freeway. Their mother rented a small white stucco bungalow. (In his comics Nik dubbed the house Casa El Camino Real, which later became Casa Real&#x2014;pronounced &#x201c;ray-al&#x201d; or &#x201c;reel,&#x201d; depending on how sarcastic you were feeling&#x2014;and they found it forever amusing to always refer to it that way; eventually even their mother called it Casa Real. By the time Nik was in high school, he had become one of those people who gives names to everything: his car, his school, his bands, his friends. One who knew him well&#x2014;say, Denise&#x2014;could tell his mood by what nickname he used. The only things that didn&#x2019;t get nicknames were his guitars. They were referred to by brand names&#x2014;the Gibson&#x2014;or by categories&#x2014;the bass&#x2014;and never as, say, his <i>axe,</i> and he never gave them gender-specific pronouns, like &#x201c;she&#x2019;s out of tune.&#x201d; Giving nicknames to his gear seemed unserious to him.)<br> <br>When they first moved in to Casa Real, Nik had his own room while Denise shared a room with her mother. Later on Denise got Nik&#x2019;s room and Nik made the back dining room&#x2014;with its own door leading outside&#x2014;into his spacious master bedroom/smoking den/private enclave. Later still he would commandeer the entire garage. Nik stapled carpet remnants on the walls and made a soundproof recording and rehearsal studio.<br> <br>For his tenth birthday, Nik wanted to go to the movies with a couple of friends and then have a cookout in the backyard with cake and presents. That was the plan. Nik wanted to see <i>Dr. Strangelove,</i> but Denise was too little, so they went to the Campus on Vermont Avenue to see the Beatles movie <i>A Hard Day&#x2019;s Night.</i> Nik was a bit of a Beatle skeptic; he had the 45s, but he wasn&#x2019;t sure it wasn&#x2019;t too much of a girl thing. The movie erased all his doubt. Denise remembered how everything about it thrilled them&#x2014;the music, of course, but also the fast cuts, the deadpan wit, the mod style, the amused asides right into the camera. The songs actually made them feel high, and in each instance felt permanently embedded in their brains by the second repetition of the chorus. They stayed in their seats right through the credits. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the party, there was no question they would have watched it again straight through.<br> <br>When Denise reluctantly followed Nik out into the afternoon light, it shocked her to discover the world was just as they had left it. There it stood in hot, hazy, Beatle-free color. No speed motion and no guitar jangle. But it didn&#x2019;t matter, because they still had the songs in their heads, and they knew they would go to see the movie again as soon as they could. They took the bus to Hollywood Boulevard to look at records. Then they walked from Hollywood Boulevard up to Franklin, and Nik began to sing the songs from the film a cappella; he could perfectly mimic the phrasing of each Beatle vocal. Nik could also imitate the Liverpool accents, and he already knew some of the lines by heart (<i>We know how to behave! We&#x2019;ve had lessons!</i>). They walked single file through the tunnel that went under the freeway (<i>He&#x2019;s very fussy about his drums, you know. They loom large in his legend</i>). Nik and Denise were still movie-drunk when they turned onto Vista Del Mar.<br> <br>Their father&#x2019;s car sat in the driveway, a white Chrysler Imperial. Nik started to run down the block.<br> <br>They found him in the backyard with their mother. He hadn&#x2019;t brought his girlfriend, and he was wearing a sport coat even though it was very warm in the late-afternoon sun. Nik ran over to him and they hugged. Denise only stared at him. She was tiny for seven, with delicate features. She didn&#x2019;t look like a baby, but more like a perfect miniature girl. She hadn&#x2019;t seen her father in a long time, and she truthfully didn&#x2019;t feel very familiar around him. He got up and grabbed her around the waist with both hands. He was very tall. Denise would always have trouble remembering his face&#x2014;she could see it in photographs, but she couldn&#x2019;t conjure it as it looked in real life. She could distinctly recall the feel of his hands gripping her. He lifted her up and squeezed her to his chest. Then he put her in the ledge of one bent arm and brushed her cheek with his hand. &#x201c;Soft,&#x201d; he said, and grinned. In photos Denise&#x2019;s father looks like one of those character actors from the fifties: he is tall and broad and has exaggerated features. He is not unhandsome. He has clear olive skin and dense shiny black hair. But he also looks a little bloated around his eyes and nose, and he looks older than he should. Now when she studies photos of him, he appears to be a man well on his way to an early heart attack, a man who clearly ate and drank too much. But when he held her then, she noticed only how good he smelled, how big his body was. When he held you, he became your entire landscape. She felt shy, but she let him carry her, kiss her cheek, and gently tug her braids.<br> <br>Nik and Denise would later agree that their father was awful. He randomly appeared and then one day he was just gone forever. &#x201c;He would have been a great uncle,&#x201d; Nik said to her the last time they had discussed it. &#x201c;The perfect present-carrying once-a-year uncle who can give you a report on how big you are and then wrestle with you for a minute before pouring himself a scotch and leaving the room.&#x201d; Their father left their mother when Nik was five, so he had some memories of living with him. Denise was two and had none. And before Nik turned eleven, their mother would wake them one Saturday morning and tell them their father had died. Nik would cry, sitting in his pajamas on the couch. Denise&#x2019;s mother also cried. Denise had to go to her room and stare at the picture she had of her father in her photo album.

He smoked a cigarette and sweated in the shadeless yard. He wore a big ring on his finger that caught the sun and sparkled. Nik and his friends drank Cokes and they spoke in embarrassed hushes, glancing at Nik&#x2019;s father. Their mother cooked the hamburgers on the grill. Denise urged Nik to open his presents.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; her mother said, &#x201c;after the cake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have something you can open now,&#x201d; her father said. He got up with a smile and went through the gate to the front, where his car was parked. They all stared at the gate until he came back, lugging a large black leather guitar-shaped case. He carried it to where Nik stood and put the case on the grass in front of him. Nik stared down at it. Although he had given Nik nice gifts in the past, the size and weight of this gift indicated an extravagance beyond any they had previously experienced.<br> <br>&#x201c;Open it, son.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nik unbuckled the case and hinged up the top. The lacquered rosewood gleamed in the sun. Their father reached down and pulled the guitar up with one hand on the neck and the other hand under the body. Mother-of-pearl was inlaid on the fingerboard between the frets, and there was matching inlay trim along the edge of the body and an inlay rosette around the sound hole. He handed it over to Nik, who pulled it to his chest. Nik stared down at it.<br> <br>He finally spoke in a reverent whisper. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; And that was it.<br> <br>� 2011 Dana Spiotta</p><h2>Living Beyond Your Feelings - Joyce Meyer</h2><p>Living Beyond Your Feelings: Controlling Emotions So They Don&#39;t Control You [ Living Beyond Your Feelings: Controlling Emotions So They Don&#39;t Control You by Meyer, Joyce ( Author ) Hardcover Sep- 2011 ] Hardcover Sep- 06- 2011</p><p></p><h2>Greek Fire, Poison Arrows and Scorpion Bombs: Biological Warfare in the Ancient World</h2><p>Flamethrowers, poison gases, incendiary bombs, the large-scale spreading of disease - are these terrifying tools of warfare modern inventions?

The major dynasties are described, as well as the archaeological discoveries that help to explain events during the time periods. Information on the problems archaeologists encountered while they worked is also included. Each of the four chapters is followed by a photo essay that further delineates specific art, artifacts, or findings from each period. For instance, the entry on the Eastern Zhou Dynasty offers a heavily illustrated essay on ``China's Desert Time Capsule,'' with crisp photographs of the relics unearthed there. Clear, full-color and black-and-white photos appear on almost every page. Diagrams and maps are also included. The book is well written, and the facts are interestingly presented. The layout is attractive. Unfortunately, there is no explanation at the beginning of the book of the organization of the chapters. Nonetheless, the excellent photography, gathering of archaeological detail, and inviting style make this volume a worthwhile addition.-Carol Kolb Phillips, The Library, East Brunswick, NJ</p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>China's rich past is brought to life in this stunning presentation of the archaeological record of the Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties. As with other books in this series, and with all Time-Life Books, the present volume is impressively illustrated with color photographs, maps, drawings, and charts. Readers will be especially interested in the well-known terra cotta army of Qin Shihuangdi, China's first emperor, and the lesser-known tomb of Lady Xin of the Han Dynasty, remarkably well preserved more than two millenniums after her death. The text is informative, presenting much detail in a manner accessible to general readers (though the use of pinyin romanization should have been accompanied by the more traditional and, for many people, more recognizable, Wade-Giles system).

When she lands a job as caretaker to Zeke, a rebellious high school senior in suburban New Jersey, it seems that the security, comfort, and happiness of the American dream may finally be within reach. Her new boss, Mister Stanley, an idealistic college professor turned Wall Street executive, assumes that Lula is a destitute refugee of the Balkan wars.

Each chapter focuses on a director's celebrated debut--be it <i>Angel</i> or <i>Blood Simple</i>, <i>Clerks</i> or <i>Diner</i>, <i>Muriel's Wedding</i> or <i>Truly, Madly, Deeply</i>--and tells the inside story: from writing the script to raising the money, from casting the actors to assembling the crew, from shooting to editing, from selling the movie to screening it. Along the way, every aspect of the movie industry is explored: from dealing with agents and moguls for the first time to pitching your movie as a debutante director, from languishing in development hell to confronting test audiences from hell.<br><br>The questions have been posed by Stephen Lowenstein, a young director with two acclaimed short films to his credit. Remembering the struggle to launch their careers, the directors have opened up about their first films and themselves to an unprecedented degree. Each chapter is not only a memoir of a particular movie, but also an emotional journey in which the director relives the pain and elation, the comedy and tragedy, of making a first feature. For anyone who wants to direct movies, these tales of triumph and disaster, of sleepless nights and nail-biting days, will be enthralling and terrifying in equal measure. For all other film fans, the interviews provide fascinating and entertaining insights into filmmakers who have become household names.</p><p>"My First Movie is a fascinating collection of life lessons from some of the greatest directors working today.

I&#x2019;m a health psychologist, and through all my training in psychology and medicine, I got one message loud and clear: Stress is toxic.</p><p>For years, as I taught classes and workshops, conducted research, and wrote articles and books, I took that message and ran with it. I told people that stress makes you sick; that it increases your risk of everything from the common cold to heart disease, depression, and addiction; and that it kills brain cells, damages your DNA, and makes you age faster. In media outlets ranging from the<i> Washington Post</i> to <i>Martha Stewart Weddings</i>, I gave the kind of stress-reduction advice you&#x2019;ve probably heard a thousand times. Practice deep breathing, get more sleep, manage your time. And, of course, do whatever you can to reduce the stress in your life.</p><p>I turned stress into the enemy, and I wasn&#x2019;t alone. I was just one of many psychologists, doctors, and scientists crusading against stress. Like them, I believed that it was a dangerous epidemic that had to be stopped.</p><p>But I&#x2019;ve changed my mind about stress, and now I want to change yours.</p><p>Let me start by telling you about the shocking scientific finding that first made me rethink stress. In 1998, thirty thousand adults in the United States were asked how much stress they had experienced in the past year. They were also asked, Do you believe stress is harmful to your health?</p><p>Eight years later, the researchers scoured public records to find out who among the thirty thousand participants had died. Let me deliver the bad news first. High levels of stress increased the risk of dying by 43 percent. But&#x2014;and this is what got my attention&#x2014;that increased risk applied only to people who also believed that stress was harming their health. People who reported high levels of stress but who did not view their stress as harmful were not more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of death of anyone in the study, even lower than those who reported experiencing very little stress.</p><p>The researchers concluded that it wasn&#x2019;t stress alone that was killing people. It was the combination of stress and the <i>belief </i>that stress is harmful. The researchers estimated that over the eight years they conducted their study, 182,000 Americans may have died prematurely because they believed that stress was harming their health.</p><p>That number stopped me in my tracks. We&#x2019;re talking over twenty thousand deaths a year! According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that would make &#x201c;believing stress is bad for you&#x201d; the fifteenth-leading cause of death in the United States, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS, and homicide.</p><p>As you can imagine, this finding unnerved me. Here I was, spending all this time and energy convincing people that stress was bad for their health. I had completely taken for granted that this message&#x2014;and my work&#x2014;was helping people. But what if it wasn&#x2019;t? Even if the techniques I was teaching for stress reduction&#x2014;such as physical exercise, meditation, and social connection&#x2014;were truly helpful, was I undermining their benefit by delivering them alongside the message that stress is toxic? Was it possible that in the name of stress management, I had been doing more harm than good?</p><p>I admit, I was tempted to pretend that I never saw that study. After all, it was just one study&#x2014;and a correlational study at that! The researchers had looked at a wide range of factors that might explain the finding, including gender, race, ethnicity, age, education, income, work status, marital status, smoking, physical activity, chronic health condition, and health insurance. None of these things explained why stress beliefs interacted with stress levels to predict mortality. However, the researchers hadn&#x2019;t actually manipulated people&#x2019;s beliefs about stress, so they couldn&#x2019;t be sure that it <i>was</i> people&#x2019;s beliefs that were killing them. Was it possible that people who believe that their stress is harmful have a different kind of stress in their lives&#x2014;one that is, somehow, more toxic? Or perhaps they have personalities that make them particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of stress.</p><p>And yet, I couldn&#x2019;t get the study out of my head. In the midst of my self-doubt, I also sensed an opportunity. I&#x2019;d always told my psychology students at Stanford University that the most exciting kind of scientific finding is one that challenges how you think about yourself and the world. But then I found the tables were turned. Was I ready to have my own beliefs challenged?</p><p>The finding I had stumbled across&#x2014;that stress is harmful only when you believe it is&#x2014;offered me an opportunity to rethink what I was teaching. Even more, it was an invitation to rethink my own relationship to stress. Would I seize it? Or would I file away the paper and continue to crusade against stress?</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>TWO THINGS in my training as a health psychologist made me open to the idea that how you think about stress matters&#x2014;and to the possibility that telling people &#x201c;Stress will kill you!&#x201d; could have unintended consequences.</p><p>First, I was already aware that some beliefs can influence longevity. For example, people with a positive attitude about aging live longer than those who hold negative stereotypes about getting older. One classic study by researchers at Yale University followed middle-aged adults for twenty years. Those who had a positive view of aging in midlife lived an average of 7.6 years longer than those who had a negative view. To put that number in perspective, consider this: Many things we regard as obvious and important protective factors, such as exercising regularly, not smoking, and maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, have been shown, on average, to add less than four years to one&#x2019;s life span.</p><p>Another example of a belief with long-reaching impact has to do with trust. Those who believe that most people can be trusted tend to live longer. In a fifteen-year study by Duke University researchers, 60 percent of adults over the age of fifty-five who viewed others as trustworthy were still alive at the end of the study. In contrast, 60 percent of those with a more cynical view on human nature had died.</p><p>Findings like these had already convinced me that when it comes to health and longevity, some beliefs matter. But what I didn&#x2019;t know yet was whether how you think about stress was one of them.</p><p>The second thing that made me willing to admit I might be wrong about stress was what I know about the history of health promotion. If telling people that stress is killing them is a bad strategy for public health, it wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time a popular health promotion strategy backfired. Some of the most commonly used strategies to encourage healthy behavior have been found to do exactly the opposite of what health professionals hope.</p><p>For example, when I speak with physicians, I sometimes ask them to predict the effects of showing smokers graphic warnings on cigarette packs. In general, they believe that the images will decrease smokers&#x2019; desire for a cigarette and motivate them to quit. But studies show that the warnings often have the reverse effect. The most threatening images (say, a lung cancer patient dying in a hospital bed) actually <i>increase</i> smokers&#x2019; positive attitudes toward smoking. The reason? The images trigger fear, and what better way to calm down than to smoke a cigarette? The doctors assumed that the fear would inspire behavior change, but instead it just motivates a desire to escape feeling bad.</p><p>Another strategy that consistently backfires is shaming people for their unhealthy behaviors. In one study at the University of California, Santa Barbara, overweight women read a <i>New York Times</i> article about how employers are beginning to discriminate against overweight workers. Afterward, instead of vowing to lose weight, the women ate twice as many calories of junk food as overweight women who had read an article on a different workplace issue.</p><p>Fear, stigma, self-criticism, shame&#x2014;all of these are believed, by many health professionals, to be powerfully motivating messages that help people improve their well-being. And yet, when put to the scientific test, these messages push people toward the very behaviors the health professionals hope to change. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve seen the same dynamic play out: Well-intentioned doctors and psychologists convey a message they think will help; instead, the recipients end up overwhelmed, depressed, and driven to self-destructive coping behaviors.</p><p>After I first discovered the study linking beliefs about stress to mortality, I started to pay more attention to how people reacted when I talked about the harmful effects of stress. I noticed that my message was met with the same kind of overwhelming feeling I would expect from medical warnings intended to frighten or shame. When I told exhausted undergraduate students about the negative consequences of stress right before final exam period, the students left the lecture hall more depressed. When I shared scary statistics about stress with caregivers, sometimes there were tears. No matter the audience, nobody ever came up afterward to say, &#x201c;Thank you so much for telling me how toxic my stressful life is. I know I can get rid of the stress, but I&#x2019;d just never thought to do it before!&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that as much as I believed talking about stress was important, how I was doing it might not be helping. Everything I had been taught about stress management started from the assumption that stress is dangerous and that people needed to know this. Once they understood how bad stress was, they would reduce their stress, and this would make them healthier and happier. But now, I wasn&#x2019;t so sure.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>MY CURIOSITY about how your attitude toward stress influences its impact sent me on a search for more evidence. I wanted to know: Does how you think about stress really matter? And if believing that stress is bad <i>is</i> bad for you, what&#x2019;s the alternative? Is there anything good about stress that&#x2019;s worth embracing?</p><p>As I pored over scientific studies and surveys from the past three decades, I looked at the data with an open mind. I found evidence for some of the harmful effects we fear but also for benefits we rarely recognize. I investigated the history of stress, learning more about how psychology and medicine became convinced that it is toxic. I also talked to scientists who are part of a new generation of stress researchers, whose work is redefining our understanding of stress by illuminating its upside. What I learned from these studies, surveys, and conversations truly changed the way I think about stress. The latest science reveals that stress can make you smarter, stronger, and more successful. It helps you learn and grow. It can even inspire courage and compassion.</p><p>The new science also shows that changing your mind about stress can make you healthier and happier. How you think about stress affects everything from your cardiovascular health to your ability to find meaning in life. The best way to manage stress isn&#x2019;t to reduce or avoid it, but rather to rethink and even embrace it.</p><p>So, my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to help you get rid of your stress&#x2014;I want to make you better at stress. That is the promise of the new science of stress, and the purpose of this book.</p><p>About This Book</p><p>This book is based on a course I teach through Stanford Continuing Studies called the New Science of Stress. The course, which enrolls people of all ages and from all walks of life, is designed to transform the way we think about and live with stress.</p><p>It&#x2019;s helpful to know a little about the science behind embracing stress for two reasons. First, it&#x2019;s fascinating. When the subject is human nature, every study is an opportunity to better understand yourself and those you care about. Second, the science of stress has some real surprises. Certain ideas about stress&#x2014;including the central premise of this book: that stress can be good for you&#x2014;are hard to swallow. Without evidence, it would be easy to dismiss them. Seeing the science behind these ideas can help you consider them and how they might apply to your own experiences.</p><p>The advice in this book isn&#x2019;t based on one shocking study&#x2014;even though that&#x2019;s what inspired me to rethink stress. The strategies you&#x2019;ll learn are based on hundreds of studies and the insights of dozens of scientists I&#x2019;ve spoken with. Skipping the science and getting straight to the advice doesn&#x2019;t work. Knowing what&#x2019;s behind every strategy helps them stick. So this book includes a crash course in the new science of stress and what psychologists call <i>mindsets</i>. You&#x2019;ll be introduced to rising-star researchers and some of their most intriguing studies&#x2014;all in a way that I hope any reader can enjoy. If you have a bigger appetite for scientific details and want even more information, the notes at the end of this book will let you dig deeper.</p><p>But most important, this is a practical guide to getting better at living with stress. Embracing stress can make you feel more empowered in the face of challenges. It can enable you to better use the energy of stress without burning out. It can help you turn stressful experiences into a source of social connection rather than isolation. And finally, it can lead you to new ways of finding meaning in suffering.</p><p>Throughout this book, you&#x2019;ll find two types of practical exercises to try:</p><p>The Rethink Stress exercises in Part 1 are designed to shift your way of thinking about stress. You can use them as writing prompts or as any other forms of self-reflection that work for you. You might think about the topic while you&#x2019;re on the treadmill at the gym or riding the bus to work. You can make it a private reflection or use it to start a conversation. Talk about it with your spouse over dinner or bring it up at your parents&#x2019; group at church. Write a Facebook post about it and ask your friends for their thoughts. Along with helping you think differently about stress in general, these exercises also encourage you to reflect on the role that stress plays in your life, including in relation to your most important goals and values.</p><p>The Transform Stress exercises in Part 2 include on-the-spot strategies to use in moments of stress, as well as self-reflections that will help you cope with specific challenges in your life. They will help you tap into your reserves of energy, strength, and hope when you&#x2019;re feeling anxious, frustrated, angry, or overwhelmed. Transform Stress exercises rely on what I call &#x201c;mindset resets&#x201d;&#x2014;shifts in how you think about the stress you are experiencing in the moment. These mindset resets can alter your physical stress response, change your attitude, and motivate action. In other words, they transform the effect that stress is having on you in the very moment you are feeling stressed. These exercises are based on scientific stu...</p></p><h2>Lost and Found: Unexpected Revelations About Food and Money</h2><p><b> The #1 New York Times bestselling author of <i>Women Food and God</i> maps a path to meeting one of our greatest challenges-how we deal with money. </b><p>When Geneen Roth and her husband lost their life savings in the Bernard Madoff debacle, Roth joined the millions of Americans dealing with financial turbulence, uncertainty, and abrupt reversals in their expectations. The resulting shock was the catalyst for her to explore how women's habits and behaviors around money-as with food-can lead to exactly the situations they most want to avoid. Roth identified her own unconscious choices: binge shopping followed by periods of budgetary self-deprivation, "treating" herself in ways that ultimately failed to sustain, and using money as a substitute for love, among others. As she examined the deep sources of these habits, she faced the hard truth about where her "self-protective" financial decisions had led. With irreverent humor and hard-won wisdom, she offers provocative and radical strategies for transforming how we feel and behave about the resources that should, and can, sustain and support our lives.</p></p><p><b>Geneen Roth</b> is a writer and a teacher who has gained international prominence through her work in the field of eating disorders.

Original.</p><p>Michael Jan Friedman is the author of more than forty science fiction and fantasy books, among them many Star Trek and Star Trek: Next Generation novels.<p>Chapter One<br> </p><p> Commander Bryce Shumar couldn't believe his turbolift had gotten stuck again. </p><p> For a moment, he just stood there, trying to remain calm -- hopeful that it was just a temporary malfunction. Then his patience was rewarded as the narrow, dimly lit compartment jerked and labored and resumed its uncertain ascent. </p><p> The damned thing hadn't been running as smoothly as he would have liked for several months already. The cranky, all-too-familiar whine of the component that drove the compartment only underlined what the commander already knew -- that the system was on its last legs. </p><p> Under normal circumstances, new turbolift parts would have appeared at the base in a matter of weeks -- maybe less. But lift parts weren't exactly a tactical priority, so Shumar and his people were forced to make do with what they had. </p><p> After a few moments, the component cycled down and the commander's ascent was complete. Then the doors parted with a loud hiss and revealed a noisy, bustling operations center -- Ops for short. It was packed with one sleek, black console after another -- all of them manned, and all of them enclosed in a transparent dome that featured a breathtaking view of the stars. </p><p> The first day Shumar had set foot there, the place had impressed the hell out of him -- almost enough to make him forget the value of what he had lost. But that was four long years ago. Now, he had learned to take it all for granted. </p><p> The big, convex viewer located in the center of the facility echoed the curve of the sprawling security console below it. Fixing his gaze on the screen, Shumar saw two ships making their way through the void on proximate parallel courses. </p><p> One was a splendid, splay-winged Rigelian transport vessel, its full-bellied hull the deep blue color of a mountain lake. The other was a black, needle-sharp Cochrane, capable of speeds as high as warp one point six, according to some reports. </p><p> It was hardly an unusual pairing, given the Cochrane's tactical advantages and the dangerous times in which they lived. Vessels carrying important cargo were almost always given escorts. Still, thought Shumar, it wouldn't hurt to make sure the ships were what they appeared to be. </p><p> "Run a scan," he told his redhaired security officer. </p><p> Morgan Kelly shot a glance at him over her shoulder. "Might I remind the commander," she said, "that no Romulan has used subterfuge to approach an Earth base since the war began? Not even once?" </p><p> "Consider me reminded," Shumar told her, "and run the scan anyway." </p><p> "Way ahead of you," said Kelly, only half-suppressing a smile. She pointed to a monitor on her left, where the vessels' energy signatures were displayed. "According to our equipment, everything checks out. Those two are exactly what they're cracked up to be -- a transport and its keeper." </p><p> Shumar frowned. "Tell them I'll meet them downstairs." </p><p> "Aye, sir," said the security officer. "And I'll be sure to tell them also what a lovely mood you're in." </p><p> The commander looked at her. "What kind of mood would <i>you</i> be in if you'd just learned your vessel had been destroyed?" </p><p> Kelly grunted. "Begging the commander's pardon, but it was nearly a month ago that you got that news." </p><p> Shumar's frown deepened. Had it really been that long since he learned what happened to the <i>John Burke?</i> "Time flies," he remarked drily, "when you're having fun." </p><p> Then he made his way back to the turbolift.<br> </p><p> Though not a human himself, Alonis Cobaryn had seen his share of Earth bases floating in the void. </p><p> The one he saw on his primary monitor now was typical of the breed. It possessed a dark, boxlike body, four ribbed cargo globes that vaguely resembled the legs of a very slow quadruped on his homeworld, and a transparent bubble that served as the facility's brain. </p><p> There was also nothing unusual about the procedure he had been instructed to follow in his approach. And now that he was within a few kilometers of the base, Cobaryn was expected to begin that procedure. </p><p> But first, he pulled a toggle to switch one of his secondary monitors to a communications function. After all, he always liked to see in whose hands he was placing his molecular integrity. </p><p> The monitor screen fizzed over with static for a moment, then showed him the Earth base's security officer -- a woman with high cheekbones, green eyes, and red hair pulled back into a somewhat unruly knot. What's more, she filled out her gold and black jumpsuit rather well. </p><p> All in all, Cobaryn mused, a rather attractive-looking individual. <i>For a human, that is.</i> </p><p> It took her about a second to take note of the visual link and look back at him. "If you were planning on cutting your engines," the woman told him, "this would be as good a time as any." </p><p> Cobaryn's mouth pulled up at the corners -- as close as he could come to a human smile. "I could not agree more," he said. Tapping the requisite sequence into the touch pad of his helm-control console, he looked up again. "I have cut my engines." </p><p> "Acknowledged," said the security officer, checking her monitors with admirable efficiency to make sure all was as it should be. </p><p> Next, Cobaryn applied his braking thrusters until he had reduced his vessel's momentum to zero and assumed a position within half a kilometer of the base. The facility loomed larger than ever on his primary monitor, a dark blot on the stars. </p><p> "That'll be fine," the redhaired woman told him. </p><p> "I am pleased that you think so," he responded. </p><p> The officer's green eyes narrowed a bit, but she wasn't adverse to the banter. At least, that was how it seemed to Cobaryn. </p><p> "I suppose you'd like to beam over now," she said. </p><p> "If it is not too much trouble." </p><p> "And if it is?" the woman asked playfully. </p><p> Cobaryn shrugged. "Then I would be deprived of the opportunity to thank you for your assistance in person." </p><p> She chuckled. "You Rigelians don't lack confidence, do you?" </p><p> "I cannot speak for others," he remarked thoughtfully, "but as for myself...I do indeed believe that confidence is a virtue." </p><p> The officer considered him a moment longer. "Too bad your pal in the Cochrane doesn't have the same attitude." </p><p> Cobaryn tilted his head. "And why is that?" he inquired, at a loss as to the human's meaning. </p><p> A coy smile blossomed on the officer's face. "No offense, Captain, but the Cochrane jockey's a lot better-looking." Then she went on, almost in the same breath, "Get ready to beam over." </p><p> Cobaryn sat back in his chair, deflated by the woman's remark -- if only for a moment. Then he recalled that humans often said the opposite of what they meant. Perhaps that was the case here. </p><p> "Ready," he replied. </p><p> "Good," said the security officer, embracing a lever in each hand. "Then here goes." </p><p> Commander Shumar stood in one of his base's smallest, darkest rooms and watched a faint shimmer of light appear like a will-o'-the-wisp over a raised transporter disc. </p><p> Gradually, the shimmer grew along its vertical axis. Then a ghostly image appeared in the same space -- a vague impression of a muscular, silver-skinned humanoid dressed in loose-fitting black togs. </p><p> The transport captain, Shumar remarked inwardly. Obviously, he had been nicer to Kelly than the pilot of the Cochrane, or the security officer would have beamed the other man over first. </p><p> The base commander watched the shaft of illumination dim as the figure flickered, solidified, flickered again and solidified a bit more. Finally, after about forty-five seconds, the process was complete and the vertical blaze of light died altogether. </p><p> A moment later, a host of blue emergency globes activated themselves in a continuous line along the bulkheads. By their glare, Shumar could make out his guest's silvery features and ruby-red eyes, which gleamed beneath a flared brow ridge reminiscent of a triceratops' bony collar. </p><p> He was a Rigelian, the commander noted. More specifically, a denizen of Rigel IV, not to be confused with any of the other four inhabited planets in the Rigel star system. And he was smiling awkwardly. </p><p> Of course, smiling was a peculiarly Terran activity. It wasn't uncommon for aliens to look a little clumsy at it -- which is why so few of them even made the attempt. </p><p> "Welcome to Earth Base Fourteen," said the human. </p><p> "Thank you," the Rigelian replied with what seemed like studied politeness. He stepped down from the disc and extended a three-fingered hand. "Alonis Cobaryn at your service, Commander." </p><p> Shumar gripped the transport captain's offering. It felt much like a human appendage except for some variations in metacarpal structure and a complete lack of hair. </p><p> "You shake hands," the base commander observed. </p><p> "I do," Cobaryn confirmed. </p><p> Shumar studied him. "Most nonhumans don't, you know." </p><p> The Rigelian's ungainly smile widened, stretching an elaborate maze of tiny ridges that ran from his temples down to his jaw. "I have dealt with your people for a number of years now," he explained. "Sometimes I imagine I know as much about them as any human." </p><p> Shumar grunted. "I wish I could say the same about Rigelians. You're the first one I've seen in person in four years on this base." </p><p> "I am not surprised," said Cobaryn, his tone vaguely apologetic. "My people typically prefer the company of other Rigelians. In that I relish the opportunity to explore the intricacies of other cultures, I am considered something of a black sheep on my homeworld." </p><p> Suddenly, realization dawned. "Wait a minute," said the human. "Cobaryn...? Aren't you the fellow who charted Sector Two-seven-five?" </p><p> The alien lowered his hairless silver head ever so slightly. "I see that my reputation has preceded me." </p><p> Shumar found himself smiling. "I used your charts to navigate the Galendus Cluster on my way to -- " </p><p> Before he could finish his sentence, the emergency illumination around them dimmed and another glimmer of light appeared over the transporter disc. Like the one before it, it lengthened little by little and gave rise to something clearly man-shaped. </p><p> This one was human, the base commander noted -- the pilot of the Cochrane, no doubt. Shumar watched the shape flicker and take on substance by turns. In time, the new arrival became solid, the shaft of light fizzled out, and the emergency globes activated themselves again. </p><p> This time, they played on a tall, athletic-looking specimen with a lean face, close-cropped blond hair, and slate-blue eyes. His garb was civilian, like that of most escort pilots these days -- a brown leather jacket over a rumpled, gray jumpsuit. </p><p> "Welcome to the base," said the commander. "My name's Shumar." </p><p> The other man looked at him for a second, but he didn't say a thing in return. Then he got down from the platform, walked past his fellow human, and left the transporter room by its only set of sliding doors. </p><p> As the titanium panels slid closed again, shutting out the marginally brighter light of the corridor outside, Shumar turned to Cobaryn. "What's the matter with your friend?" he asked, as puzzled as he was annoyed. </p><p> The Rigelian smiled without much enthusiasm. "Captain Dane is not very communicative. The one time we spoke, he described himself as a loner." He regarded the doors with his ruby-red orbs. "Frankly, given his attitude, I am surprised he takes part in the war effort at all." </p><p> "The one time?" Shumar echoed. He didn't get it. "But he was your escort, wasn't he?" </p><p> "He was," Cobaryn confirmed in a neutral tone. "Still, as I noted, he was not a very loquacious one. He appeared to be troubled by something, though I cannot imagine what it might have been." </p><p> Shumar frowned. "It wouldn't hurt him to say a few words when he sets foot on someone else's base. I mean, I'm not exactly thrilled about my lot in life either right now, but I keep it to myself." </p><p> The Rigelian's eyes narrowed. "You would rather be somewhere else?" </p><p> "On a research vessel," Shumar told him unhesitatingly, "conducting planetary surveys. That's what I did before the war. Unfortunately, I'll have to get hold of a new ship if I want to pick up where I left off." </p><p> "The old one was commandeered, then?" asked Cobaryn. </p><p> Shumar nodded. "Four years ago, when I was given command of this place. Then, a little more than a month ago, it was blown to bits by the Romulans out near Gamma Llongo." </p><p> The Rigelian sighed. "You and I have much in common, then." </p><p> The commander looked at him askance. "Don't tell me they pressed <i>you</i> into service. You're not even human." </p><p> "Perhaps not," said Cobaryn.

At its center are two twentieth-century men who represent different kinds of power&#x2014;Kenneth Toomey, a past-his-prime author of mediocre fiction, a man who has outlived his contemporaries to survive into, bitter, luxurious old age, living in self-exile on Malta; and Don Carlo Campanati, a man of God, eventually of church revolution and a candidate for sainthood beloved Pope, who rises through the Vatican as a shrewd manipulator to become the architect.<p>Through the lives of these two modern men Burgess explores the very essence of power in a narrative that spans from Hollywood, to Dublin, Nairobi, Paris, and beyond.</p></p><p>Anthony Burgess was an English author, poet, playwright, composer, linguist, translator and critic, best known for his dystopian satire <i>A Clockwork Orange. </i>In 2008, <i>The Times</i> placed Burgess number 17 on their list of &#x201c;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Hobby of Murder</h2><p>When seven friends gather to welcome retired professor Andrew Basnett to their village in the English country-side, conviviality soon turns to crime as guests suddenly start dying -- and Basnett finds himself seeking a clever killer who&#39;s sure to strike again.</p><p>Andrew Basnett, over 70, is stooped and, like this British mystery, seems barely to creep along. Restless after completing a time-consuming biography, the retired professor heads for a two-week country vacation at the home of old friends Mollie and Ian Davidge. He is introduced to the village notables at a dinner given by the local squire, Sam Waldron, who is replicating a menu from the 18th century. Ernest Audley, solicitor; Felicity Mace, doctor; Brian Singleton, biochemist; Brian's well-known brother Luke, an author of thrillers; and 16 others are deep in conversation at the meticulously set table when Luke collapses, poisoned by cyanide. Police Inspector Roland, conveniently at the dinner, begins the classic investigation by interrogating all guests. Motives abound, and then another body is discovered in the town's pond. Andrew's intuition is happily utilized by the unimaginative Roland, who has worked with him before. Unfortunately, the villagers are a colorless lot, the plot convoluted and contrived and even Andrew seems bored with the proceedings. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Alexander the Great</h2><p>From award-winning historian Robin Lane Fox, Alexander the Great searches through the mass of conflicting evidence and legend to focus on Alexander as a man of his own time. Tough, resolute, fearless, Alexander was a born warrior and ruler of passionate ambition who understood the intense adventure of conquest and of the unknown. When he died in 323 BC aged thirty-two, his vast empire comprised more than two million square miles, spanning from Greece to India. His achievements were unparalleled - he had excelled as leader to his men, founded eighteen new cities and stamped the face of Greek culture on the ancient East. The myth he created is as potent today as it was in the ancient world. Combining historical scholarship and acute psychological insight, Alexander the Great brings this colossal figure vividly to life. 'So enjoyable and well-written ... Fox's book became my main guide through Alexander's amazing story'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Stone, director of Alexander 'I do not know which to admire most, his vast erudition or his imaginative grasp of so remote and complicated a period and such a complex personality'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyril Connolly, Sunday Times 'An achievement of Alexandrian proportions'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;New Statesman Robin Lane Fox was the main historical advisor to Oliver Stone on his film Alexander, and took part in many of its most dramatic re-enactments. His books include The Classical World: An Epic History of Greece and Rome, The Unauthorised Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible, Travelling Heroes: Greeks and their Myths in the Epic Age of Homer and Pagans and Christians in the Mediterranean World from the Second Century AD to the Conversion of Constantine.</p><p>Robin Lane Fox is Emeritus Fellow of New College, Oxford, and was until 2014 Reader in Ancient History in Oxford University. He is the author of Pagans and Christians (1986), The Unauthorised Version (1992) and many books on classical history, including Alexander the Great (1973), The Classical World (2005) and Travelling Heroes (2008), all of which have been widely translated.

A former manager deemed her "the single most ambitious singer he has ever known," and given the tenacity with which she faced early setbacks&#x2014;"I have a noble history of being rejected from a lot of places," she writes&#x2014;his comment is understandable. After her first big break in 1990 (as the Countess in Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro with the Houston Grand Opera), Fleming's rise to the top was steady. But she's quick to point out that the life of an opera star is not always glitter and glamour; the business side of singing&#x2014;scheduling performances, arranging interviews and recordings, choosing a repertoire and marketing herself&#x2014;is arduous. Although Fleming offers glimpses into her personal life, touching on her failed marriage and her loving relationship with her two daughters and concluding with a chapter describing what she experiences backstage during a Metropolitan Opera production, this is not a deeply intimate autobiography full of childhood vignettes, personal anecdotes and behind-the-curtains gossip. Instead, it's a realistic portrait of what it takes to succeed and a volume intriguing for its advice and honesty. Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kim Sun�e tells us so much about the French that I never learned in 25 trips to Paris, but mostly about the terrors and pleasure of that infinite octopus, love. A fine book."<br><br>When Kim Sun�e was three years old, her mother took her to a marketplace, deposited her on a bench with a fistful of food, and promised she'd be right back. Three days later a policeman took the little girl, clutching what was now only a fistful of crumbs, to a police station and told her that she'd been abandoned by her mother.<br><br>Fast-forward almost 20 years and Kim's life is unrecognizable. Adopted by a young New Orleans couple, she spends her youth as one of only two Asian children in her entire community. At the age of 21, she becomes involved with a famous French businessman and suddenly finds herself living in France, mistress over his houses in Provence and Paris, and stepmother to his eight year-old daughter.<br><br>Kim takes readers on a lyrical journey from Korea to New Orleans to Paris and Provence, along the way serving forth her favorite recipes. A love story at heart, this memoir is about the search for identity and a book that will appeal to anyone who is passionate about love, food, travel, and the ultimate search for self.</p><p>Kim Sun�e is the founding food editor of <em>Cottage Living</em>. She was born in South Korea and adopted and raised in New Orleans, and lived in Europe for ten years. She now resides in Birmingham, Alabama.On making Sunee's acquaintance in the introduction to this charming memoir, it's hard not to envy the young woman swimming laps in the pool overlooking the orchard of her <i>petit ami</i>'s vast compound in the High Alps of Provence, but below the surface of this portrait is a turbulent quest for identity. Abandoned at age three in a Korean marketplace, Sunee is adopted by an American couple who raise her in New Orleans. In the 1990s she settles, after a fashion, in France with Olivier Baussan, a multimillionaire of epicurean tastes and&#x2014;at least in her depiction&#x2014;controlling disposition. She struggles to create a home for herself in the kitchen, cooking gargantuan meals for their large circle of friends, until her restive nature and Baussan's impatience with her literary ambitions compel her to move on. The gutsy Cajun and ethereal French recipes that serve as chapter codas are matched by engaging storytelling. Alas, for all Sunee's preoccupation with the geography of home, her insights on the topic are disappointingly slight, and the facile wrapup offered in the form of resolution seems a shortcut in a book that traverses so much rocky terrain. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They appear as his epitaph in Rome's Protestant cemetery. Often called the greatest English poet after Shakespeare, Keats had a lifelong preoccupation with early death. This sense of mortality, along with the poet's famous, unrequited love for Fanny Brawne, sparked dozens of finely written sonnets and lyrics of love.</p><p>This beautifully crafted collection contains some of the most heartfelt of Keats' personal poems. "La Belle Dame Sans Merci A Ballad" and "The Eve of St. Agnes" are paragons of the gothic lyric, wherein mysterious lovers, dream visions, and late-night fantasy come magically to life. Lighter verse, such as "Where be ye going, you Devon maid?" and such passionate, pensive poems as "When I have fears that I may cease to be" provide a personal glimpse of the young poet's dreams and dreads.</p><p>This selection of twenty-six poems also presents an introduction to the life of John Keats, notes on the indivdual poems, and ten illustrations, half of which are of biographical interest and half underscore thematic elements contained in the poems.</p></p><p><p><b>John Keats</b> (1795-1821), born in Finsbury Pavement in London, was one of the principal poets of the English Romantic movement.

Easy-to-follow instructions and copious color photographs cover the preparation, planting, care, and maintenance of various garden types; other topics include the basics of good design and propagating methods. Steiner does mention some of the benefits of using native plants, but it would have been helpful to highlight them so they could be recognized at a glance. She also mentions the importance of avoiding invasive plants; the information is not region-specific, but checking invasiveplantatlas.org is suggested. A handy reference card listing websites of state extension offices and native plants is also included. <b>VERDICT:</b> Overall, these books provide a very good introduction to and broad overview of gardening with excellent step-by-step instructions.

To read <i>Concepts of Force</i> is to gain a new and profound understanding of force and dynamics." &#x2014; R. T. Weidner, <i>Physics Today<br></i>Both a historical treatment and a critical analysis, this work by a noted physicist takes a fascinating look at one of the fundamental and primordial notions in physical theory, the concept of force.<br>Tracing its development from ancient times to the twentieth century, the author demonstrates how Kepler initiated the scientific conceptualization of the idea of force, how Newton attempted a clear and profound definition, and how post-Newtonian physicists reinterpreted the notion &#x2014; contrasting the concepts of Leibniz, Boscovich, and Kant with those of Mach, Kirchhoff, and Hertz.

Her approach is simultaneously intimate and archetypal: "Once upon a time there was no time.... There was only darkness and the waters of the deep and a father and son who watched over them." The son is at the heart of the tale, performing the acts of creation; the approving father names each of the son's works. Grimes captures the essence of a father/son relationship, with its mutual love and admiration, while also conveying the unique status of this particular father/son dynamic. Her lyrical gifts are everywhere in abundance, set out with a deceptive simplicity that evokes an oral tradition; fittingly, Morin's (The Orphan Boy) mixed-media illustrations also evoke the art of oral cultures. His animals, fish and flowers look as if they are made of fabric, embroidered or woven, painted on clay; the vivid colors look dyed; the patterns and designs conjure up images of indigenous art from around the world. This story speaks to the heart of Christian theology, stirringly depicting God's passionate love for creation, a love that would consent to become sacrificial--these complex lessons are implied, and the graceful delivery of sophisticated themes and imagery will entice readers to delve for such deeper meanings. All ages. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kindergarten-Grade 3-John's Gospel insists that God's Son was present at creation: "and without him was made nothing that is made." Nevertheless it will come as a jolt to many readers of Grimes's creation story to have Jesus lending a hand at the dawn of time. The Father gives commands and names; the Son is the maker. Both creators express feelings about their work: longing and laughing, sighing and loving. For the most part, the language is dignified, though Jesus does instruct Adam and Eve to "Enjoy." Monotheists may feel that the plural pronoun makes too prominent an appearance in the last words of the book: "they rested." The art is bold and inventive.

I recall being in a rather buoyant mood, having sold that afternoon a mid-Victorian drop-leaf table for a most welcome amount. It must have been half past seven. The sky outside the window was particularly beautiful, I remember thinking. One of those glorious May sunsets that crams all the beauty of the day into its dying moments.</p><p>Now, where were you? Yes: your bedroom. You were practising your cello, as you had been since Reuben had left to meet his friends at the tennis courts.</p><p>At the time I heard it, the scream, I had already lowered my gaze towards the park. I think I must have been looking over at the horse chestnuts, rather than the empty climbing frame, because I hadn&#x2019;t noticed anyone on East Mount Road. There was some kind of numerical discrepancy I was trying to solve; I can&#x2019;t remember what precisely.</p><p>Oh, I could hold that scene just there. I could write ten thousand words about that sunset, about that park, about the trivial queries of my profit and loss accounts. You see, as I write I am back inside that moment, I am back there in that room, wrapped up warm in that unknowing contentment. For this pen to push that evening on, to get to the moment where the sound of the scream actually meant something, seems a kind of crime. And yet I have to tell you how it was, exactly as I saw it, because this was the end and the start of everything, wasn&#x2019;t it? So come on, Terence, get on with it, you don&#x2019;t have all day.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>The scream struck me first as a disturbance. An intrusion on the sweet sound of whatever Brahms sonata was floating to me from your bedroom. Then, before I knew why, it caused a kind of pain, a twist in my stomach, as if my body was understanding before my mind.</p><p>Simultaneous with the sound of the scream, there were other noises, coming from the same direction. Voices unified in a chant, repeating a two-syllable word or name I couldn&#x2019;t quite catch. I looked towards the noise and saw the first street lamp stutter into life. Something was hanging from the horizontal section of the pole. A dark blue shape that didn&#x2019;t immediately make sense, high above the ground.</p><p>There were people standing below - boys - and the hanging object and the chanting gained clarity in my mind at the same time.</p><p>&#x2018;Reuben! Reuben! Reuben!&#x2019;</p><p>I froze. Maybe too much of me was still lost in my account books as, for a second or so, I did nothing except watch.</p><p>My son was hanging from a lamp post, using the greatest of strength to risk his life for the sake of entertaining those he thought were friends.</p><p>I felt things sharpen and began to move, gaining momentum as I ran across the landing.</p><p>Your music stopped.</p><p>&#x2018;Dad?&#x2019; you asked me.</p><p>I rushed downstairs and through the shop. My hip knocked into something, a chest, causing one of the figurines to drop and smash.</p><p>I crossed the street and ran through the gate. I crossed the park at the pace of a younger self, flying over the leaves and grass and through the deserted play area. All the time I kept him in sight, as if to lose him for a second would cause his grip to weaken. I ran feeling the terror beat in my chest, behind my eyes and in my ears.</p><p>He shuffled his hands closer towards the vertical section of the post.</p><p>I could see his face now, glowing an unnatural yellow from the lamp. His teeth bared with the strain, his bulging eyes already knowing the insanity of his mistake.</p><p>Please, Bryony, understand this: the pain of a child is the pain of a parent. As I ran to your brother I knew I was running to myself.</p><p>I stepped on the park wall and jumped down to the pavement, landing badly. I twisted my ankle on the concrete but I fought against it as I ran towards him, as I called his name.</p><p>Your brother couldn&#x2019;t move. His face was twisted in agony. The glare of the light blanched his skin, releasing him of the birth mark he always hated.</p><p>I was getting closer now.</p><p>&#x2018;Reuben!&#x2019; I shouted. &#x2018;Reuben!&#x2019;</p><p>He saw me as I pushed my way through his friends. I can still see his face and all the confusion and terror and helplessness it contained. In that moment of recognition, of distraction, the concentration he needed to stay exactly where he was suddenly faltered. I could feel it before it happened, a kind of gloating doom leaking out from the terraced houses. An invisible but all-encompassing evil that stole every last hope.</p><p>&#x2018;Reuben! No!&#x2019;</p><p>He fell, fast and heavy.</p><p>Within a second his screaming had stopped and he was on the concrete pavement in front of me.</p><p>Everything about him seemed so hideous and unnatural as he lay there, like an abandoned puppet. The crooked angles of his legs. The accelerated rhythm of his chest. The shining blood that spilt from his mouth.</p><p>&#x2018;Get an ambulance,&#x2019; I shouted at the crowd of boys who stood there in numb silence. &#x2018;Now!&#x2019;</p><p>In the distance cars sped by on Blossom Street, heading into York or out to the supermarket, immune and unaware.</p><p>I crouched down and my hand touched his face and I pleaded with him to stay with me.</p><p>I begged him.</p><p>And it seemed like some kind of deliberate punishment, the way he died. I could see the decision in his eyes, as the substance of life retreated further and further from his body.</p><p>One of the boys, the smallest, vomited on the pavement.</p><p>Another - shaven-headed, sharp-eyed - staggered back, away, onto the empty road.</p><p>The tallest and most muscular of the group just stood there, looking at me, a shaded face inside a hood. I hated that boy and the brutal indifference of his face. I cursed the god who had made this boy stand there, breathing before me, while Reuben was dying on the pavement. Inside the desperate urgency of that moment I sensed there was something not quite right about that boy, as though he had been pasted onto the scene from another reality.</p><p>I picked up one of Reuben&#x2019;s heavy hands, his left, and saw his palm was still red and indented from holding onto the post. I rubbed it and I kept talking to him, words on top of words, but all the time I could see him retreating from his body, backing away. And then he said something.</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t go.&#x2019; As if it was me who was leaving and not him. They were his last words.</p><p>The hand went cold, the night gathered closer and the ambulance came to confirm it was too late for anything to be done.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>I remember I saw you across the park.</p><p>I remember leaving Reuben&#x2019;s body on the pavement.</p><p>I remember you asked me, &#x2018;Dad, what&#x2019;s happening?&#x2019;</p><p>I remember saying, &#x2018;Go back, Petal, go back home. Please.&#x2019;</p><p>I remember you asked about the ambulance.</p><p>I remember I ignored the question and repeated my demand.</p><p>I remember the boy in the hood, staring straight at you.</p><p>I remember I became insistent, I remember grabbing your arm and shouting, I remember being harsher with you than I had ever been.</p><p>I remember the look on your face and I remember you running back home, to the shop entrance, and the door closing. And the knowledge below the madness that I had betrayed you both.</p><p>As you know, for much of my life I have spent my time mending broken things. Repairing clock dials, restoring old chairs, retouching china. Over the years I have become accomplished at removing stains with ammonia, or a dab of white spirit. I can remove scratches from glass. I can simulate different grains of wood. And I can restore a corroded Tudor candlestick with vinegar, half a pint of hot water and a piece of fine wire wool.</p><p>To buy a George III mahogany dressing table suffering the scars and strains of two centuries, and then return it to its original glory, once gave me such a thrill. Or equally, to have Mrs Weeks come into the shop and run her informed fingers over a Worcester vase without detecting the cracks, not so long ago filled my soul with happiness.</p><p>It gave me a kind of power, I suppose. A means of defeating time. A way of insulating myself against this foul, mouldering age. And I cannot explain to you the desperate pain it gives me to know that I cannot restore our own private past in quite the same way.</p><p>Here is something you must understand.</p><p>There have been four people in this life I have truly loved, and out of those four, you are the only one remaining. All of the others died of unnatural causes. Son, wife, mother. All three before their time.</p><p>You love three people and they die. It hardly warrants a public inquiry, does it? No. How many would you have to love and watch die before people grew suspicious of that love? Five? Ten? A hundred? Three is nothing. A fig. Three is just plain old bad luck, even if it is three-quarters of all you have ever cared for in the world.</p></p><h2>Occult Tibet: Secret Practices of Himalayan Magic</h2><p>A great esoteric tradition developed in the Himalayan fastnesses of the Tibetan plateau.

We came from a distant galaxy to colonize this planet, but lost our memories and spacefaring abilities in the process. <br>In a creation tale unlike any other, the Jigten Chagtsul tells how an alien race evolved in a world at the center of the universe. This race was known as the Lha and their planet was beautiful, with hills, valleys, rivers, streams, trees, and flowers much like our own. On it, the Lha developed astounding powers but remained subject to old age and death. They lived mortal lives and disputed among themselves over possessions and property, much as humans do today. <br>The Jigten Chagtsul forms part of the Ch�jung, a body of historical doctrine that was written down in the thirteenth century but which reflects a much older tradition. This doctrine describes not just the beginnings of our world, but of &#x201c;all worlds.&#x201d; In passages oddly reminiscent of modern scientific findings, it speaks of a void before time out of which a foam emerged to form the foundation of matter.1 <br>The planet at the center of the universe was named the Rirab Lhunpo, after a massive mountain on its surface. Our own planet Earth was known as the Dzambu Lying, and began as an empty globe devoid of people, animals, or vegetation. Later it was colonized by members of the Lha who made it their own. <br>The extraordinary powers of the Lha ensured they lived in comfort. They practiced a form of deep meditation called samten se which enabled them to create matter, including food and useful artifacts, solely by the power of their minds. Their bodies glowed with an inner radiance. <br>Unfortunately, something in Earth&#x2019;s environment&#x2015;the scriptures suggest it was an indigenous foodstuff to which the visitors took a liking&#x2015;caused a weakening and eventual disappearance of the Lha&#x2019;s powers. They lost their inner radiance, along with the ability to create matter, and became the progenitors of the human race. The Lha, say these ancient Tibetan records, are our most distant ancestors. <br>Curiously, this mythic history is reflected in the traditions of the Dzopa, a tribe from the remote mountains of Baian-Kara-Ula on the Tibet-China border. These tiny people, who share none of the racial characteristics of their neighbors, claim they came from Sirius, a binary star in the constellation Canis Major some 8.6 light-years from Earth. <br>News of the Dzopa first emerged in 1938 when Chinese archaeologists discovered little human bones with disproportionately large skulls in a cave system of the Baian-Kara-Ula mountains. The bones were accompanied by artifacts in the form of stone discs with spiral grooves cut into their surfaces. These discs were subsequently investigated by an Englishman, Dr. Karyl Robin-Evans, who travelled to China in 1947 after being shown one which he claimed lost and gained weight over a 3.5-hour cycle. <br>From China, Robin-Evans travelled to the Tibetan capital Lhasa, then on to the Baian-Kara-Ula mountainswhere he made contact with the Dzopa and learned their tribal history from a religious leader named Lurgan-La. According to this history, two expeditions had been sent to Earth from the Sirius star system. The first arrived more than twenty thousand years ago, and the second, much more recently, in 1014 c.e. Lurgan-La claimed his tribe originated with the second visit, which ended in disaster when the spaceship crashed. <br>In 1962, Dr. Tsum Um Nui of the Peking Academy of Prehistory claimed to have decoded the spiral engravings on the stone discs. He maintained they contained records of a spaceship that crashed to Earth twelve thousand years ago,2 but the academic establishment failed to take his paper seriously.3 <br>A more orthodox account of Tibetan prehistory suggests that some twenty million years ago the area that is now Tibet lay at the bottom of the sea.4 Plate tectonics&#x2015;the gradual movement of the Earth&#x2019;s surface&#x2015;caused a slow, massive folding of the seabed into a series of parallel mountains. Alluvial silt eventually filled the valleys between the folds when rain-bearing winds from the Indian Ocean wore down the peaks. The result was the Tibetan plateau which rises to an average height of sixteen thousand feet above sea level. <br>The great Himalayan range that protects Tibet today was a more recent addition. The mountains certainly rose to their present height within the last half-million years, and current geological investigation suggests they may be far more recent&#x2015;the result of a massive cataclysmic upheaval dated no more than ten to twelve thousand years ago. <br>But whenever they rose, the Himalayas created Tibet as it is known today. The mountains form a twenty-four-thousand-foot-high barrier stretching 1,500 miles from east to west. It is a barrier that blocks the monsoon winds and has turned much of Tibet&#x2015;and indeed central Asia as a whole&#x2015;into a chill desert. It also put a stop to humanity&#x2019;s ancient migrations across the central Asian steppes and led to an isolation that has been Tibet&#x2019;s most dominant cultural characteristic for centuries. Until the Chinese invasion of October 1950, you could generally count the number of foreign residents in Tibet on the fingers of one hand. <br>A land will always sculpt its people. Isolation has been Tibet&#x2019;s predominant cultural characteristic; its most obvious physical characteristics are thin air and biting cold, and both have profound implications for those who live there. When the London Times correspondent Perceval Landon visited Phag Ri, Tibet&#x2019;s highest settlement, in 1904, he found a ramshackle village of listless, unwashed inhabitants. An open sewer in the center of the main street contained excrement, offal, and the corpses of long-dead dogs in a hideous mixture that scarcely maintained its slow, curdled flow. <br>The characteristic listlessness sprang from oxygen deprivation. At eighteen thousand feet, Phag Ri was not only the highest town in the country, but in the world. Even Tibetans found it difficult to cope with the thin air. The appalling state of public and personal hygiene was compounded by the listlessness, but sprang mainly from the lack of free water, most of which was locked up as ice all year round. The open sewer flowed only due to the latent heat of the excrement it contained. In the barren land, fuel was at a premium. What little there was had to be preserved for essentials like cooking. Water for washing was a luxury. Bathing was unthinkable. <br>Phag Ri is an extreme example, but remained typical of pre-invasion Tibet in its hygiene standards. Yet despite such conditions, there was comparatively little infectious illness in the country and the great plagues that killed millions in neighboring India and China were unheard of in Tibet. This was partly due to the low population density, but a far more important factor was the cold&#x2015;bacteria simply do not thrive. <br>Once attention is focused on the cold, the thin air, the rocky, inhospitable, infertile land, and the lack of natural resources such as oil, coal, or timber, certain developments become predictable. The first is a small population. The land will not support the teeming millions of India or China. The second is long-term cultural stability, possibly declining into stagnation. Once a balance is reached between population and resources, there is little incentive to change old ways of doing things, and no money to spare for major changes anyway. <br>An examination of Tibetan history shows these factors clearly. Although impoverished by Western standards, Tibet never faced famine. Largely unaware of the world outside, its people saw nothing of which to be envious. There was no incentive to change and the country remained a feudal monarchy, albeit of an unusual type, until change was forced upon it by external intervention. <br>But contrary to its modern image, Tibet was not always a peace-loving country. For centuries there was a constant ebb and flow <br>of military campaigns with neighboring China. Tibetan warlords gained the upper hand as often as their Chinese counterparts, but in the twentieth century, China modernized its military machine while Tibet did not. By this time, Tibet had long since initiated an experiment unique in the modern world. As a culture, it had embarked on a spiritual path that precluded the use of violence. <br>Most scholars attribute the first hesitant steps on this path to the arrival of Buddhism in the seventh century c.e. Tibetan chronicles record the event in a suitably miraculous context. According to these sources, an early century king named Lhato Thori was on the roof of his palace in Tibet when an enormous casket fell from the sky at his feet. Inside were certain religious scriptures, a scale model of a golden tomb, and the six sacred syllables of what became the Tibetan Prayer of Everlasting Truth. <br>Although the B�npoba (practitioners of Tibet&#x2019;s aboriginal B�n religion) claim the miraculous scriptures as their own, they are more widely believed to have been the Buddhist Dunkong Shakgyapa. Buddhist or B�n, the illiterate king was unable to read them, but he was able to recognize a good omen when it fell from the sky. Thus he stored the chest away safely and embarked on a daily worship of the books, a practice that doubled his life span to 120 years. <br>(The idea that Tibetan mystics discovered the secret of longevity has proved remarkably persistent. In James Hilton&#x2019;s popular romance The Lost Horizon, residents of Shangri-La, a Himalayan kingdom based on Tibet, remained youthful for centuries so long as they did not venture from their valley home.) <br>Shortly after he began his religious discipline, King Lhato Thori was visited by the Buddha in a dream. The Buddha told him that the secret of the books would remain hidden to him, but after five generations a stranger would explain the texts to the people. Here, too, we find an ancient reflection of Tibetan esoteric practice which, as we shall also see later, makes very interesting use of dreams. <br>Five generations later, the prophecy came true. In the second decade of the seventh century, King Srontsan Gampo decided the strange scriptures inherited from his predecessor should be translated into Tibetan and dispatched a team of seventeen scholars to India in search of instruction. At the time Tibet had no written language but one of the scholars, a government minister named Thonmi Sambhoto, actually devised one, a monumental achievement loosely based on the Kashmiri Sharada alphabet. <br>Once this hurdle was crossed, not only was the secret of the ancient Dunkong Shakgyapa revealed, but a great many other scriptures, both Buddhist and Hindu, were translated into Tibetan. Although King Srontsan Gampo was a B�n practitioner, he was strongly attracted to the new religion. When he subsequently married two Buddhist princesses&#x2015;one from Nepal, the other from China&#x2015;he decided to convert. In this way, Buddhism was introduced into Tibet, and while for a time it remained confined to the royal family, it eventually spread. <br>For anyone brought up within the revealed religions of Christianity, Judaism, or Islam, Buddhism is a strange doctrine. It denies not only the existence of God, but of a human soul. It teaches reincarnation&#x2015;the great wheel of birth, death, and rebirth&#x2015;but believes an individual&#x2019;s greatest aspiration is to cease to incarnate. Above all, its practitioners follow the Buddha&#x2019;s central precept, &#x201c;Seek your own salvation with diligence.&#x201d; <br>This precept has given the religion enormous flexibility and led it to adapt to the prevailing conditions of different countries as it spread. Sometimes the adaptation has been extreme. Buddhism as practiced in Japan (under the name of Zen) bears little resemblance to its Indian root. Buddhism as practiced in Tibet was to share the same fate. <br>In an attempt to explain the emergence of B�n in his country, the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s older brother Abbot Thubten Jigme Norbu had this to say: <br>Every traveller who has set foot in Tibet has commented on the wild countryside. . . . It is a country that can be so still and quiet and so beautiful that even we who have been born in it . . . are affected strongly. [But] just as it can be quiet, it can also be so tumultuous that it seems as though the world were coming to <br>an end. . . . If the country is powerful in its quiet moments, it is something much more than powerful when it is black. . . . Living in a world like this, it is difficult not be become dominated by it.5 <br>There seems little doubt that B�n emerged in reaction to the country of its birth exactly as the abbot suggests, but so, too, did Buddhism. Indeed there are so many similarities between Buddhism and B�n it is often difficult to tell them apart. Thubten Jigme Norbu again: <br>There is no way of telling whether a man is a B�npoba or a Buddhist when you meet him. His clothes, his manner of speech, his behaviour, all are the same as our own. Inside his house the altar might be a little different . . .6 <br>Like Buddhism, the B�n religion had its monasteries. Both types of monasteries were organized in exactly the same way. Monks in each took exactly the same number of vows&#x2015;253. Itis clear that B�n borrowed from Buddhism. It is equally clear that in Tibet, Buddhism borrowed from B�n. Tibetan occultism drew heavily on both traditions and permeated the entire culture. Until the Chinese invasion, the government was a reincarnatory monarchy whose decisions were guided by spirit voices speaking through a state oracle. A communications system had been developed using entranced runners and, according to some sources at least, telepathy. Prior to 1950, Tibet was arguably the strangest place on Earth. How did all this strangeness come about? <br>Abbot Norbu struck the right chord when he was speaking about B�n. Tibet is a wilderness of extremes. The beauty of the country is breathtaking. The stillness is profound, the silence almost tangible. It positively calls the human soul to meditate. But Tibet is also wild. It is subject to earthquakes that are capable of swallowing whole villages. Although the monsoons are blocked by the mountains, there are storms of such violence that a hillside&#x2015;and anyone on it&#x2015;can be washed away in a matter of minutes. When the wind howls, the noise seems to fill the universe. As the abbot says, it is only human nature that the people who live in such a country will do their best to develop shamanic systems designed to control its natural forces. <br>But there is another, even more interesting, factor that comes into play. There is a phenomenon well known in the world of high-altitude mountaineering. Those who engage in the sport call it the &#x201c;unseen companion.&#x201d; Climber after climber, including several engaged in Everest expeditions, has reported the eerie sensation of being accompanied by something or someone on the final stages of their climb, even though no one was actually there. Rather more controversially, one or two have even claimed that the unseen presence seemed to help them when they got into trouble, and protected them against the worst effects of blizzards by guiding their footsteps back to safety. <br>The occultist Aleister Crowley, no mean mountaineer himself, learned the unseen companion had a negative side when he tackled Himalayan peak K2, known locally as Kanchenjunga, the second highest mountain in the world. Although Crowley was courageous to the point of stupidity when climbing, he met with something on Kanchenjunga that terrified him.

A contemporary of Kreutzer and Rode, Pierre Marie Francois de Sales Baillot provides in his treatise many insights into the style of nineteenth-century fingering, bowing, ornamentation, and expressiveness that are not apparent from the directions and markings found in scores of that time. Such information will be invaluable for performers interested in understanding the intentions of composers such as Viotti, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn.&nbsp;This complete, unabridged translation, which includes an extensive introduction by the translator, Louise Goldberg, and a foreword by Zvi Zeitlin, will be indispensable for musicologists, performers, and lovers of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century classical music.</p><p>Pierre Baillot (1771-1842) was a violinist, teacher, writer, and composer. Professor of violin at the Conservatoire National de Musique in Paris for forty-seven years, he toured widely in Europe and Russia; he was a member of Napoleon's chamber orchestra, first violinist in Louis XVIII's string quartet, and solo violinist of the orchestra of the Paris Opera.&nbsp;Louise Goldberg is Head of Rare Books and Special Collections at the Sibley Music Library of the Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester.

The story opens with young Peter's first look at the engine - blue boiler and red wheels, puffing smoke and hissing steam, gears spinning and rods stroking back and forth - and old Mr. Torgrimson's wise prediction: "You know, Peter, you're witnessing the beginning of real scientific farming."<br><br>This is Peter's own story of how he and his little sister Anna learned to farm, and how it all changes the day Mr. Parker's steam-threshing rig rumbles onto their place. All the neighbors come to help, and so does Aunt Mavis with her recipe for buffalo-berry pie and her stories about the children's pioneer Norwegian grandparents. Threshing begins when the engine's whistle awakens the threshers, bundle pitchers, and wagon teams, and calls them to work in the darkness long before dawn. While the men thresh the grain, the women and girls prepare five meals a day for a horde of hungry threshermen. The end of the workday comes only when darkness falls again. For Peter and Anna summer brings long days of hard work, reunion with family and friends, and some sadness too.<br><br>Beyond this tale of Peter and his family is the story of steam power on the American farm. It was the steam traction engine - the first farm "tractor" - that plowed America's vast prairie grasslands and threshed the fields of wheat stretching to the horizons. Thrashin' Time is about growing up on a farm in the midst of fundamental change, but even more it is a tribute in words and pictures to America's farm families and a long-gone way of life.</p><p>Peter (12) has heard a lot about steam engines, and he even saw one thrashing wheat at a neighbor's last year, but now the big steam tractor is coming to his farm. He and his six-year-old sister, Anna, get to stay home from school, but have to work hard--Anna makes 200 rolls a day for the hungry thrashers, while Peter drives the water wagon to keep the big engine supplied. Best, he gets to help Mr. Parker, the engineer, keep the engine running--and Mr. Parker even gives Peter his old engineering books as a parting gift. This window on the past depicts farm life in North Dakota just after the turn of the century, at the dawn of modern farm mechanization, with painstaking verisimilitude. The meticulous pen drawings of the tractor, separator, and thrashers are large, handsome, and full of engrossing detail. As narrated by Peter, the story is chiefly a vehicle for conveying a sense of time and place--food, people, tasks; still, here, too, the authentic detail holds interest. Some historical notes would have helped-- 15 storytellers are credited, but who were they? How much of the story is fact? And, though a carefully labeled drawing of the tractor is included, there are few technical details. All in all, however, an attractive book that does what it sets out to do. (Nonfiction. 11+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 4 Up-- Tucka-tucka-tucka-tucka-tucka--ss--ss--ss--ss--The sounds of a steam-driven thrashing machine have passed into history, and nearly from the memory of most adults. So how are children to learn about this romanticized fragment of American past? Thrashin' Time should fill that information gap, and provide much visual enjoyment. This is a startlingly beautiful book, painstakingly typeset, with white space ample enough to suggest effortless reading. The prose is colorful, but as good as the writing is, the real power of the book is in Weitzman's fine line drawings, many on a double-page spread, each one frameable. He includes not only drawings of the steam engine at work, detailed labeled models, but also extraordinary illustrations of people involved in various aspects of thrashing: the crew at rest, the man driving the horse-drawn mower, the women preparing the much-lauded noon meal. This may not be a book that children will pick up automatically, but, once introduced, it will be appreciated by a wide audience. --Lee Bock, Brown County Public Libraries, Green Bay, WI<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Inca Trail, Cusco &amp; Machu Picchu, 3rd: Includes the Vilcabamba Trek &amp; Lima City Guide</h2><p>This guide features ten hikes from two days to two weeks with thirty-four detailed route maps showing walking times, camping places, and all points of interest.

Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson: Investigating the Sexual Secrets of America&#39;s Most Famous Men and Women</h2><p>Blood Moon&#x2019;s newest book examines the hidden sexual secrets of long-time companions, FBI Directors J. Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson, and their decades-long obsession with the darkest indiscretions of famous Americans.<br><br>This is history&#x2019;s first exposure of J. Edgar&#x2019;s obsession with voyeuristic sex and its links to the priorities of his law enforcement agency. It&#x2019;s the most detailed and most shocking insight into J. Edgar Hoover ever published, an unprecedented overview of a life devoted to unveiling other people&#x2019;s darkest secrets while rigorously concealing his own. Award-winning celebrity biographer Darwin Porter answers the questions you&#x2019;ve always wanted to know. But if you&#x2019;d asked them during Hoover&#x2019;s heyday, he&#x2019;d probably have had you investigated and punished. <br><br>&#x201c;The book,&#x201d; according to Blood Moon&#x2019;s president, Danforth Prince, &#x201c;goes much farther than the Clint Eastwood/Leonardo DiCaprio film, J. Edgar. Hoover enforced his status as a kingmaker through eight presidential administrations, shrewdly manipulating social unrest, wars, and political rivalries to make his &#x2018;dictatorship&#x2019; of the FBI indispensible. He developed a talent for blackmail that terrorized presidents, senators, journalists, congressmen, and public advocates who included both Eleanor Roosevelt and Martin Luther King, Jr. He secretly delivered or deliberately withheld information about issues related to national security as a means of reinforcing his personal power, and he manipulated public anxieties in ways that allowed Red-baiter Joseph McCarthy to destroy some of the most creative people in Hollywood. He collaborated with the darkest factions within American society, including the Mafia, and eventually evolved into one of the most widely loathed people in America, often assuming that no one would dare to publish an expos� of how his shocking sexual values and priorities survived, and flourished, within the FBI.<br><br>&#x201c;But eventually, as the book reveals, many of Hoover&#x2019;s victims inaugurated investigations of their own. Anecdotes were bruited throughout Washington, New York, and Los Angeles and mockingly discussed, in front of witnesses, by key figures in law enforcement, the military, the entertainment community, and the porn industry. And the more famous Hoover became, the more recognizable he was to the male hustlers and everyday, run-of-the-mill gay men he encountered at the private parties and orgies he attended with or without Clyde. This book reveals many of these dynamics in ways never before exposed.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You can expect a lot from this book, and it richly delivers. It presents stories from both within the FBI and tales from its victims. Compiled from decades of meticulous research, dozens of first-hand interviews, and information recently released through the Freedom of Information Act, Darwin Porter distills J. Edgar&#x2019;s 50-year obsession with communists, &#x2018;sexual perverts,&#x2019; and dissenters of any ilk into a spellbinding read.&#x201d;</p><p>THE DARK SIDE OF THE AMERICAN CENTURY Under direct orders from J. Edgar Hoover, iron-fisted G-Men spent decades ferreting out the most damaging scandals of America&#x2019;s most famous women, including Eleanor Roosevelt and Marilyn Monroe, and damaging secrets about its most influential men, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Elvis Presley, and the Kennedys. Yet somehow, Hoover and Tolson managed to keep the lid on their own Pandora&#x2019;s Box, threatening to destroy any journalist or politician who tried to expose them. <br><br>Compiled with meticulous care over many decades, the book is a chilling portrait based on candid claims made by some 1,000 people who socialized with, worked with, or encountered Hoover. It also contains titillations found in hundreds of little-known documents. For the first time, we hear from Guy Hotell, an FBI agent who was Clyde Tolson&#x2019;s roommate in the 1940s and 50s. He often accompanied Hoover and Tolson on their free-loading vacations, where they sought sun, sex, and safe bets at Mafia-controlled race tracks. <br><br>Behind his back, eight American presidents held Hoover in disdain. But they found him useful for gathering career-destroying information about their enemies. In candid remarks, all of them mocked his homosexuality. One of Hoover&#x2019;s bosses, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, told aides, &#x201c;I expect Hoover to walk in the door any minute wearing one of Jackie&#x2019;s discarded Dior dresses.&#x201d;<br><br>During the compilation of this book, unusual sources were tapped, including eyewitnesses who would speak freely only after Hoover&#x2019;s death in 1972. Revealing remarks were made by two of Hollywood&#x2019;s most visible actresses, Dorothy Lamour and Ethel Merman, whom Hoover jokingly referred to as &#x201c;my gun molls.&#x201d; Each of them helped their friend acquire gowns and fashion accessories for dressing in drag. <br><br>It was not just an urban legend: Hoover was both a closeted homosexual and a transvestite. He was also a voyeur, acccumulating the nation&#x2019;s largest cache of pornography. He particularly favored frontal nudes of male movie stars. As Hoover grew older and Tolson&#x2019;s allure faded, he turned to a series of male hustlers, well-endowed young men supplied by pimps behind the scenes. Many of them talked. <br><br>Other tantalizing details exposed within this book include:<br><br>How Hoover took personal (undeserved) credit for mowing down &#x201c;Public Enemies&#x201d; in the 1930s, including Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson... and how he became fascinated by the penis of the slain &#x201c;Public Enemy Number One,&#x201d; John Dillinger, nicknamed &#x201c;Donkey Dong.&#x201d;<br><br>The crush Hoover developed on a young entertainer from Cuba, Desi Arnaz, then appearing on Broadway. Arnaz was arrested by the FBI, strip-searched, and photographed, nude. Later, after Hoover turned on Arnaz, he vindictively exposed Arnaz&#x2019;s wife, Lucille Ball, as a communist, fully aware that the accusation might destroy her I Love Lucy TV sitcom. <br><br>Before and during World War II, Hoover kept Franklin D. Roosevelt in check with the threat of exposing that he&#x2019;d moved his mistress into the White House, and that his lesbian wife, Eleanor, had moved in a female lover whom FDR referred to as &#x201c;my wife&#x2019;s squaw.&#x201d;<br><br>During the witch-burning heyday of Red-baiter Joseph McCarthy, Hoover supplied the fuel for fires that ignited alleged communists. But then, Hoover learned that the Wisconsin senator concealed secrets that were darker than any of those he had exposed.<br><br>Hoover vs. The Kennedys, worthy of a drama by William Shakespeare, is a story of betrayals and ultimate tragedy. Days before JFK flew to Dallas for his assassination, Hoover warned him that the Senate was about to publicly investigate his sexual involvements with KGB-sponsored prostitutes within the White House. <br><br>The FBI&#x2019;s pursuit of Elvis Presley: Hoover instructed his agents to gather evidence that the singer was a bisexual who had engaged in an incestuous relationship with his mother, Gladys.<br><br>How J. Edgar orchestrated relentless searches for celebrities he claimed were &#x201c;as red as their underwear,&#x201d; probing deep into the lives of Americans as diverse as Marlene Dietrich, Errol Flynn, Albert Einstein, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Marlon Brando, and Jane Fonda&#x2014;and what he found. <br><br>In the 1940s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt told his trusted but promiscuous (gay) aide, Sumner Welles, &#x201c;Hoover&#x2019;s caught all of us with our pants down. but someday, someone is going to catch him jaybird naked and involved in the most lustful, perverted behavior.&#x201d; <br><br>With the publication of Darwin Porter&#x2019;s newest book, that long-awaited day has come at last.<br><br>Darwin Porter has been fascinated by the FBI ever since his widowed mother began dating a G-Man who presented him with a Junior G-Man badge in the mid 1940s. <br><br>Porter never became an FBI agent himself, but turned his investigative skills into reporting. Over the years, he gathered stories from dozens of Hollywood celebrities and FBI men, many in retirement in Florida. Sometimes, they spoke freely about their experiences in the FBI. Many others, however, preferred to keep their secrets, and those of J. Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson, to themselves. <br><br>Today, Porter is one of the world&#x2019;s leading celebrity biographers, having written books on such diverse figures as Katharine Hepburn, Paul Newman, Howard Hughes, Marlon Brando, Humphrey Bogart, Michael Jackson, Steve McQueen, the Kennedys, and Frank Sinatra. <br><br>He is also the co-author of the popular Hollywood Babylon series, and is also the co-author of Damn You, Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara, which exposed the complicated and deeply anguished private lives of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. <br><br>Currently, Porter is working on Marilyn at Rainbow&#x2019;s End, destined for a publication during the Spring of 2012 and devoted to exploring the mysterious final years in the life of blonde sex goddess Marilyn Monroe.

It became THE hot book--and the numbers prove it: We've sold more than 250,000 copies to date. To top it off, Candace Bushnell was the apple of the press's eye. Her signature glamour, poise, and humor lit up TV screens, newspapers, and magazines across America.<br><br> While Janey Wilcox may want to be on top, it's clear that Candace Bushnell's <em>Trading Up</em> IS on top. With an even wider paperback audience, who knows how much higher she can climb?</p><p>Janey Wilcox is an M.A.W. (that's Model/Actress/Whatever to the uninitiated). The problem with Janey, the protagonist of Candace Bushnell's first novel, <i>Trading Up</i>, is not the M or the A part. It's the W. Here is a rare alphabetical anomaly: In Janey's case, W stands for "prostitute." Oh, Janey never crosses the line into actual hookerdom, but she does sleep with extremely wealthy men in the hopes they'll improve her status, her financial situation, or her lifestyle. When we first met Janey in Bushnell's novella collection <i>4 Blondes</i>, she was up to her usual tricks (so to speak)--scamming a guy for a Hamptons vacation rental. At the opening of <i>Trading Up</i>, her fortunes have improved. She's now the star of a Victoria's Secret ad campaign, and as such she's found access to undreamed-of echelons of New York society. She makes friends with Mimi Kilroy, a senator's daughter "at the very top of the social heap in New York." She gets invited to all the best parties. And she finally finds a wealthy man who will actually marry her: Seldon Rose, a powerful entertainment industry executive. Of course, Janey's social ambitions are not stoppered by her marriage to Seldon, and the clash between her expectations (more parties!) and his (normal life) send Janey into a tailspin that leads to heartbreak. Bushnell is clearly trying to channel Edith Wharton (<i>The Custom of the Country</i> is even invoked by Janey as a screenplay idea), but ends up sounding a lot more like a cross between Tama Janowitz and Judith Krantz. This is a novel about shopping and sex, and while it's fizzy enough, it's not Cristal. <i>--Claire Dederer</i><b>Candace Bushnell</b> is the author of the international bestsellers <i>Sex and the City</i> and <i>4 Blondes</i>.

Yamamoto&#39;s career in the Imperial Japanese Navy started in the early years of the 20th century and he saw service in the Russo-Japanese War, being wounded in the battle of Tsushima in 1904. He went on to study at Harvard University and serve as a naval attach� in the inter-war years, an experience that was to give him a unique insight into the American psyche. Despite the success of his daring pre-emptive strike on Pearl Harbor in 1941, that damaged the US Pacific Fleet and ushered in the Pacific War, Yamamoto&#39;s subsequent handling of the Japanese combined fleet can be called into question. The final campaign commanded by Yamamoto was that around Guadalcanal, where Yamamoto&#39;s myth of excellence will be totally laid bare. Despite a considerable numerical advantage over the Americans, Yamamoto never brought this advantage to bear. The result was a devastating defeat for the Imperial Japanese Navy and, eventually, the death of Yamamoto himself.</p><p>"In Yamamoto Isoroku (Japanese nomenclature places family name first) author Mark Stille delves into key early-WWII Japanese campaigns orchestrated by arguably one of Japan's most famous admirals. And as he traces Yamamoto's life from upbringing to Imperial Combined Fleet Command, Stille offers insight into the mind of the man behind the legend." --<i>Rachel E.

Clements Prize, Best Non-Fiction Book on Southwestern America, 2004</b></p><p>Not quite the United States and not quite Mexico, La Junta de los Rios straddles the border between Texas and Chihuahua, occupying the basin formed by the conjunction of the Rio Grande and the Rio Conchos. It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the Chihuahuan Desert, ranking in age and dignity with the Anasazi pueblos of New Mexico.</p><p>In the first comprehensive history of the region, Jefferson Morgenthaler traces the history of La Junta de los Rios from the formation of the Mexico-Texas border in the mid-19th century to the 1997 ambush shooting of teenage goatherd Esquiel Hernandez by U.S. Marines performing drug interdiction in El Polvo, Texas. "Though it is scores of miles from a major highway, I found natives, soldiers, rebels, bandidos, heroes, scoundrels, drug lords, scalp hunters, medal winners, and mystics," writes Morgenthaler. "I found love, tragedy, struggle, and stories that have never been told." In telling the turbulent history of this remote valley oasis, he examines the consequences of a national border running through a community older than the invisible line that divides it.</p></p><p>JEFFERSON MORGENTHALER is a lawyer and corporate communications consultant in Boerne, Texas.&#34;No other history of the area has approached the broad interpretation of this book as it weaves this intensive study of La Junta so closely into the international trends and events taking place in Texas, Mexico, and the United States. . . .

An article of great timeliness on the priesthood according to St. John Chrysostom as well as an important study of the long debate over the salvation of Origen are among the texts included in the first section, devoted to patristics and Christian humanism. The second section, comprised entirely of an unpublished work on tripartite anthropology tracing the body-soul-spirit distinction from St. Paul, the patristic tradition, St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, up to the modern period, will prove an invaluable guide for further study and reflection. The section concludes with a beautiful text entitled "The Light of Christ", a prayerful meditation written during the dark hours of Nazi domination. Section three deals with disputed theological questions such as the internal causes of the disappearance of the sense of the sacred, the mystery of the supernatural, and the development of dogma. He also has a section on Christian resistance to Nazism and anti-semitism, as well as two sections on the thought and writings of several important modern spiritual writers.</p></p><p><p><b>Henri de Lubac, S.

He enjoys swilling tequila, parachuting off a 600-foot rock and getting much too close to his source, the temptress who calls herself Alice Malone. Suggesting a way to nail Leo Harker, a retired law-and-order judge who raises fighting pit bulls, Alice makes it possible for Macky to photograph the judge indulging in his bloody illegal sport. But that's not enough: Alice soon blackmails Macky into helping her kill the judge, whom she accuses of torturing her and degrading her sexually. The graphic descriptions of dogs fighting to the death, of Alice's sadomasochistic tendencies and of the horrible method used to dispose of the judge are not for the squeamish. Still, so long as we don't have to meet these nasty folks in person, Ring raising Cain is a rousing experience. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.In a riveting tale of suspense and adven ture, Judge Leo Harker and Russell Macky, an investigative reporter for the Tucson News Gazette , face off in a dispute over illegal dog fighting in Arizona. Only one person recognizes the full power and determination of the two men. For motives of her own, she baits and goads them as deliberately as pit bull trainers condition their dogs. And, as pit bulls fight to the death, so these two men continue their conflict until only one is still alive. The battle is enthralling: the characters attack, regroup, and attack again, re sponding to the killer instinct called to the surface by outside forces. In this, his third novel, Ring ( Telluride Smile; Peregrine Dream) draws inspiration from the dark side of human nature and mental dysfunction to create an unflattering but vivid image of the underbelly of Arizona society and culture that will not be easily forgot ten.<br><i>- Thomas L.

Known for making vivid, memorable, and often controversial work, Victore has sought comrades, not clients&#x2014;brave, smart collaborators who have encouraged him to reinterpret old design solutions and to pressure viewers to think about issues in a new way. Leading readers through this collection of &#x201c;greatest hits,&#x201d; Victore tells the stories behind his inspirations, his process, and the lessons learned.

After serving in the Army as a combat engineer, Andrew entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and received his degree just before his death in 2008, at the age of 27.Ryan Kealey is on a mission to rescue the secretary of state, who has been kidnapped by terrorists in Pakistan.

His characterizations reflect the subtle contrasts between the Washington chiefs and the field operatives, particularly Kealey.

It integrates philosophical approaches to landscape perception with anthropological studies of the significance of the landscape in small-scale societies. This perspective is used to examine the relationship between prehistoric sites and their topographic settings. The author argues that the architecture of Neolithic stone tombs acts as a kind of camera lens focussing attention on landscape features such as rock outcrops, river valleys, mountain spurs in their immediate surroundings. These monuments played an active role in socializing the landscape and creating meaning in it.A Phenomenology of Landscape is unusual in that it links two types of publishing which have remained distinct in archaeology: books with atmospheric photographs of monuments with a minimum of text and no interpretation; and the academic text in which words provide a substitute for visual imagery. Attractively illustrated with many photographs and diagrams, it will appeal to anyone interested in prehistoric monuments and landscape as well as students and specialists in archaeology, anthropology and human geography.</p><p>This book is an extended photographic essay about topographic features of the landscape.

His creation has already changed the way people do business, entertain themselves, exchange ideas, and socialize with one another. With new online businesses and communities forming every day, the full impact of Berners-Lee's grand scheme has yet to be fully known.</p><p>Berners-Lee's creation was fueled by a highly personal vision of the Web as a powerful force for social change and individual creativity. He has never profited personally from the Web but has devoted himself to its continued growth and health. Now, this low-profile genius tells his own story of the Web's origins-from its revolutionary introduction and the creation of the now ubiquitous WWW and HTTP acronyms to how he sees the future development of this revolutionary medium. Today, Berners-Lee continues to facilitate the Web's growth and development as director of the World Wide Web Consortium and from his position at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science.</p><p>Berners-Lee offers insights to help readers understand the true nature of the Web, enabling them to use it to their fullest advantage. He shares his views on such critical issues as censorship, privacy, the increasing power of software companies in the online world, and the need to find the ideal balance between the commercial and social forces on the Web. His incisive criticism of the Web's current state makes clear that there is still much work to be done. Finally, Berners-Lee presents his own plan for the Web's future, one that calls for the active support and participation of programmers, computer manufacturers, and social organizations to make it happen.</p><p>His vision of the Web is something much more than a tool for research or communication; it is a new way of thinking and a means to greater freedom and social growth than ever before possible.</p></p><p>If you can read this review (and voice your opinion about his book on Amazon.com), you have Tim Berners-Lee to thank. When you've read his no-nonsense account of how he invented the World Wide Web, you'll want to thank him again, for the sheer coolness of his ideas. One day in 1980, Berners-Lee, an Oxford-trained computer consultant, got a random thought: "Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked?" So he created a system to give every "page" on a computer a standard address (now called a URL, or Universal Resource Locator), accessible via the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), formatted with the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and visible with the first browser, which did the trick of linking us all up.<p> He may be the most self-effacing genius of the computer age, and his egalitarian mind is evident in the names he rejected for his invention: "I thought of Mine of Information, or MOI, but <i>moi</i> in French means 'me,' and that was too egocentric.... The Information Mine (TIM) was even more egocentric!" Also, a mine is a passive repository; the Web is something that grows inexorably from everyone's contributions. Berners-Lee fully credits the colorful characters who helped him get the bobsled of progress going--one colleague times his haircuts to match the solstices--but he's stubbornly independent-minded. His quest is to make the Web "a place where the whim of a human being and the reasoning of a machine coexist in an ideal, powerful mixture."</p><p> Hard-core tech types may wish Berners-Lee had gone into deeper detail about the road ahead: the "boon and threat" of XML, free vs. commercial software, VRML 3-D imaging, and such. But he wants everyone in on the debate, so he wrote a brisk book that virtually anyone can understand. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web, is currently the director of theWorld Wide Web Consortium, the coordinating body for Web development, and heoccupies the 3Com Founders chair at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science.Recipient of numerous awards, he received the distinguished MacArthurFellowship in 1998.

One of the most illustrious figures of the English literary tradition, Johnson made his fame as poet, essayist, critic, dictionary-maker, conversationalist, and all-around larger-than-life personality. His success was all the greater for the adversity he had to overcome in achieving it.<p>Drawing on a lifetime of study of Johnson and his era, as well as a wide array of new archival materials, noted biographer Jeffrey Meyers tells the extraordinary story of one of the great geniuses of English letters. Johnson emerges in his portrait as a mass of contradictions: lazy and energetic, aggressive and tender, melancholy and witty, comforted yet tormented by religion. He was physically repulsive and slovenly in dress and habits, but his social ideas were progressive and humane he strongly opposed slavery and the imperial exploitation of indigenous peoples. He gave generously to the poor and homeless, rescued prostitutes, and defended criminals who'd been condemned to hang. But these charitable acts could not dispel the darkness that clouded his world: overwhelming guilt and fear of eternal damnation.</p><p>A masterful portrait of a brilliant and tormented figure, this book reintroduces a new generation of readers to the heroic Dr. Johnson.</p></p><p><b>Jeffrey Meyers</b> holds a Ph.D. in English literature. He has written over twenty books, and is a frequent contributor to the <i>New Criterion</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>, and <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>. He lives in Kensington, California.*Starred Review* The second major new biography anticipating the natal tercentenary of the predominant figure in eighteenth-century English literature is by a much more prolific biographer than Peter Martin, whose fine Samuel Johnson&nbsp;(2008) took Johnson&#x2019;s&nbsp;melancholy as its organizing theme. Meyers, whose previous subjects include movie stars, painters, and twentieth-century writers, structures his life around Johnson&#x2019;s struggles not&nbsp;just with his morbid cast of mind but to accomplish virtually everything he achieved. That difference in emphasis has little effect on the core story both biographers tell, which is one of a rise from poverty to preeminence achieved despite great physical (Johnson had Tourette&#x2019;s syndrome, a blind eye, and partial deafness) as well as psychological handicaps. Meyers, however, celebrates Johnson the author more than Martin does. He argues the quality of Johnson&#x2019;s poems, essays, biocritical sketches, the philosophical romance Rasselas, and even the sermons he wrote for his clerical friend John Taylor by examining Johnson&#x2019;s craft.

And then one autumn night, the worst possible thing happened....<br><br>Now, a decade later, Chadwick&#x2019;s heart is on the mend. Working for an old military buddy, he saves kids for a living, escorting troubled teens to a Texas wilderness school that specializes in the toughest brand of love.<br><br>Until he gets a phone call that threatens to shatter his new life.<br><br>Mallory Zedman is taking the same terrible path Chadwick&#x2019;s own daughter once took. Defiant and out of control, Mallory is determined to destroy herself and anyone who tries to stop her. No sooner does Chadwick snatch her off the streets than he discovers she is wanted for questioning in a brutal murder--a slaying that seems directly linked to Chadwick&#x2019;s past.To save Mallory, tough love will not be enough. Chadwick must find the truth behind the murder--and in doing so revisit the infidelities, shattered promises, and violent passions that cracked his world apart. And he must jeopardize the one thing he still has left to lose--a slim hope of redemption.</p><p>Aptly subtitled "A Novel of Secrets," this dark, probing tale examines the destructive ripple effects of a child's death on those around her--especially after doubts arise whether it was accident, suicide, or murder. In the harrowing opening pages, 16-year-old Katherine Chadwick ODs on heroin while babysitting little Mallory, daughter of her parents' best friends. Then the tale leaps forward nine years: both couples' marriages are in ruins; Katherine's father, once a schoolteacher, is now a bruising "escort" for a reform school in the Texas outback called Cold Springs; and his next assignment is to capture none other than Mallory, now 15 and in trouble.<p> Texas native Riordan, whose Tres Navarre series has earned acclaim and awards, evokes the landscapes around Cold Springs with vividness and authority, and also brings that sensibility to the book's Bay Area scenes: </p><blockquote> Chadwick ... stepped out into the growing gloom of the evening. Down the block, he could hear the lowrider cruising, its stereo setting off car alarms all across the neighborhood like a bloodhound flushing quail. </blockquote> But it's the book's complex plot and richly realized people--most notably its troubled teenagers (Riordan is a middle-school teacher)--that give <i>Cold Springs</i> substance and heft. You may need to persist through some tangled exposition in the first 75 pages or so, but the payoff is well worth it. The long climax offers a stunning series of cascading revelations, including a final kicker that changes everything. Riordan is the real deal. <i>--Nicholas H.

They were already late, a double annoyance to Jack Absolute; not only was it considered ungentlemanly to keep people waiting for such an affair, but it also meant that by the time the ground had been reached, the Seconds introduced, the area marked out, and the formalities dealt with as to wills and burials, it would be too dark for pistols. It would have to be swords; and by the look of him, his opponent was in fighting trim. If he wasn't twenty years younger than Jack he wasn't far off and, as a serving cavalry officer, would be fencing daily; while it was five years at the least since Jack had fought in such a manner. With a variety of other weapons, to be sure. But a tomahawk or a Mysore punch dagger had a very different feel to them than the delicate touch required for the small sword. Of course, one could only be killed with the point; it had no cutting edge. But the point, as Jack knew all too well, was all that was required.</p> <p>As his feet slipped yet again on the icy boot prints of those who had preceded him, Jack cursed. How large will the damned crowd be? The affair could hardly have been announced more publicly, and many would choose to attend such a fashionable fight. Money would already have been staked. He wondered at the odds. Like an older racehorse, Jack had form. He had "killed his man"-in fact, in the plural, several more than these gentlemen of London could know about. But his opponent was certainly younger, probably stronger, and above all, inflamed with the passion of wronged ardor. He fought for a cause. For love.</p> <p>And Jack? Jack fought only because he'd been too stupid to avoid the challenge.</p> <p>He sniffed. To top it all, he suspected he was getting a cold. He wanted to be warm in the snug at King's Coffee House, a pot of mulled ale in his hand. Not slip-sliding his way across a frozen common to maiming or a possible death.</p> <p>"Is it five or six duels you have fought, Daganoweda?"</p> <p>Jack, whose eyes had been fixed on the placing of his own feet, now glanced at the speaker's. Their nakedness seemed like vanity, especially as Jack knew his companion had a fine pair of fleece-lined boots back in their rooms in St. Giles. However, At� would never pass up such an opportunity to display the superior toughness of the Iroquois Indian. The rest of him would probably have been naked too had Jack not warned him that ladies might attend. The concession had been fawn-skin leggings, beaded and tasseled, and a Chinese silk vest that scarcely concealed his huge chest or obscured the tattoos wreathed around his muscles. Midnight-black hair fell in waves to his almost bare shoulders. Just looking at him made Jack shiver all the more, and he pulled his cloak even tighter around him.</p> <p>"Six duels, At�dawenete. As I am sure you well remember. Including the one against you."</p> <p>"Oh," At� turned to him, his brown eyes afire, "you count a fight against a &#x2018;savage,' do you? I am honored."</p> <p>The Indian made the slightest of bows. Iroquois was a language made for irony. Jack had had too much cognac the night before-the first error in an evening of them-and a duel of wits was one conflict he could live without today. So he reverted to English.</p> <p>"What is it, At�? Homesick again?"</p> <p>"I was thinking, brother, that if this young brave kills you-as is very likely since he is half your age and looks twice as vigorous-how then will I buy passage to return to my home across the water, which you have kept me from these eleven years?"</p> <p>"Don't concern yourself with that, brother. Our friend here will give you the money. It's the least he can do. He owes me after all, don't you, Sherry?"</p> <p>This last was addressed over his shoulder to the gentleman acting as his First-Second, as the hierarchy of duels had it. The dark-haired young man was struggling to keep pace with his taller companions, his face alternately green and the palest of yellows. The previous evening, Richard Brinsley Sheridan had drunk even more cognac than Jack.</p> <p>"Ah, money, Jack, yes. Always a wee bit of a problem there." Though he had left Ireland as a boy, a slight native brogue still crept in, especially in moments of exertion. "But, of course, you'll be triumphant today, so the need will not arise. And in the meantime, can you and your fine-looking friend speak more of that marvelous language? I may understand not a word, but the cadences are exquisite."</p> <p>Jack pulled a large, soiled square of linen from his pocket and blew his nose hard. "Careful, At�, you'll be in one of his plays next. And we all know where that can lead."</p> <p>The playwright wiped an edge of his cloak across a slick brow, sweating despite the chill. "How many more times can I apologize? As I said, you were thought dead and thus your mellifluous name was free to appropriate."</p> <p>"Well, I may be dead soon enough. So your conscience may not be a bother too much longer," Jack muttered. He had caught sight of movement through a screen of trees ahead.</p> <p>If the crowd's big enough, he thought, perhaps even the incompetent Watch might have heard of it and turn up to prevent this illegality. Once he would have objected vigorously to any attempt by the authorities to restrict his right to fight. Once...when he was as young as his adversary, perhaps. Now he could only hope that the Magistrates' intelligence had improved.</p> <p>But no reassuring Watchmen greeted Jack, just two dozen gentlemen in cloaks of brown or green, a few red-coated army officers, and, in the center of the party, wearing just a shirt, the man who had challenged him-Banastre Tarleton. Jack was again startled by his face. The youth-he could be no more than eighteen-was possessed of an almost feminine beauty, with thickly lashed eyes and chestnut curls failing to be constrained by a pink ribbon. But there was no hint of a lady's fragility in his movements, laughing as he lunged forward with an imaginary sword.</p> <p>He looks as if he is on a green about to play a game of cricket, Jack thought, and he wondered if it was the cold that made him shrug ever deeper into his cloak. He glanced around the circle of excited faces that turned to him. No women, at least. Not even the cause of this whole affair, that little minx, Elizabeth Farren. The hour was too close to the lighting of the footlights at Drury Lane and her show must go on. Yet how she would have loved playing this scene. The sighs, the sobs wrenched from her troubled-and artfully revealed, carefully highlighted-bosom, as she watched two lovers do battle for her. She would be terribly brave one moment, close to fainting the next.</p> <p>An actress. He was going to be killed over an actress. It was like one of Sheridan's bloody comedies, not dissimilar to the one in which the playwright had made him the unwitting star. It was an irony perhaps only an Iroquois could fully appreciate. For if Sheridan hadn't used his name in The Rivals, if Jack hadn't then felt it necessary to watch some posturing actor play "him," if he hadn't succumbed, yet again, to the effects of brandy and the actress playing the maid, and if she wasn't already beloved by this brash, stupid, handsome, young officer...</p> <p>At� and Sheridan had moved across to commence the business, and Jack noted the two men with whom his companions were discussing terms. One, an ensign in the resplendent, gold-laced uniform of the Coldstream Guards, was talking loudly and waving his arms about. Yet it was the other, Tarleton's Second-Second, who held Jack's attention. He was standing behind and slightly to the side, his will seemingly focused, not on the details of the duel, but entirely forward onto Jack, just as it had been the previous night, when his soft whispers had urged Tarleton on. This man had the sober but expensive dress of a rich cleric, the long, pale face of a scholar. And looking now at the man he'd heard named the Count von Schlaben, even in the poor light of a winter sunset, Jack could see that this man desired his death as much as the youth who had challenged him; perhaps even more. And in that moment of recognition, Jack knew that there was more than actresses involved and that honor was only a small part of this affair.</p> <p>If I am about to die, he thought, looking away and up into the cloud-racked March sky, the least I can do is to understand why.</p> <p>Something had occurred the previous night at the theater, aside from the play and the challenge. Something that had brought them all here to this snowy common. So it was back to Drury Lane that Jack's mind went, in the few moments before the formalities were settled, and the dying began.</p></p><h2>Matriarch: Queen Mary and the House of Windsor</h2><p>Chronicles the life of Princess May of Teck, from her selection as bride for the Duke of Clarence to her rise to queen and mother of two kings</p><p>In addition to being the author of Vivien Leigh: A Biography and Matriarch: Queen Mary and the House of Windsor, Anne Edwards has written numerous other biographies, including Sonya: The Life of Countess Tolstoy, Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell, and Early Reagan: The Rise to Power.&#34;A magnificent portrayal of majesty. . . .

I watched Granmama from the back of the station wagon until first her copper skin faded into the colors of the landscape, and then the speck that was her dress drifted, as if blown by the wind, out of the road and up the stairs of her front porch. That was the last time I saw her.<br> </p><p> Granmama's funeral was held in the church where she had taken us on summer Sundays. The church stood tall and blinding white in the middle of a stretch of orange Mississippi dirt. Our family sat on the front pew, and because I was the baby, I sat next to Mama, holding her arm tight while my sisters and brothers sat quietly with their eyes wide open. Mama and the aunts wore veils, all their heads erect, their eyes and mouths invisible. The sun filtered through the stained-glass window, breaking the light into streams of orange and yellow where dust particles floated like dandelion seeds. </p><p> Our Grandeddy sat on the elder's pew at the front of the church. The wood dipped where he sat rocking to the soothing sound of the choir. He was the fattest black man I ever knew, and in the stained-glass light, he was so black, he was almost purple. The whites of his eyes were yellow like yolks. I stared at his face full of misery and regret for the woman that I never saw him hug or kiss. Their relationship was a lot like Mama and Deddy's, always cutting each other down with a list of regrets, but the babies came like seasons. </p><p> That day Grandeddy's face was hard and cold, not grinning behind a sip of white lightning like it usually was. In his white shirt and suspenders he looked worn, his age dusty on his black skin. I rocked with him and the rest of the family, and looked all over the church for some shift in things that would help me understand what was happening. He rolled the program tighter and tighter where the roughness of his hands against the paper sounded faint behind the harmony of the choir. Their voices lifted into the beams of the church and resonated inside my chest. </p><p> <i>Walk the streets of glo-ry<br> Let me lift my voice...</i><br> </p><p> The sweetness of the voices pushed Mama and the aunts into sobs and tears that sent me into tears, and I struggled to get around Mama's shaking arms and into her lap. </p><p> The adults fanned themselves to the beat, moaning like Granmama's cow when Grandeddy took her calf and sold it down the road. I watched Grandeddy. </p><p> The music paused, and the reverend stood. His voice echoed in the rafters. "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." </p><p> He wiped the spit from his mouth with a handkerchief and motioned for the choir to hum the procession song. People lined up to look in the casket, like they were lining up for communion. There we all sat waiting, me, the littlest Blackburn. The church framed us, my two sisters and two brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, all the descendants of Grandeddy. </p><p> A tall, sturdy woman walked by in the procession and looked into my eyes. She lifted me from Mama's side, just swooped down like a hawk. When Mama looked up and saw through tears and veil that this woman was taking me to view the body, she pushed her veil up and yelled, but I cannot remember the sound that came from her mouth, because the humming had turned to singing, and somebody was shouting out the Holy Spirit in front of the casket, but when this woman looked into my eyes, the singing and moaning were muted. She looked down at Granmama and whispered in my ear, "Don't you never forget her face. You was her best granbaby. She tried to love you because she couldn't love her own." </p><p> I didn't recognize the voice that sounded so much like Granmama's, but let my three-year-old ear linger there on what felt familiar, her breath warm like comfort where nothing else made sense. </p><p> In the still of that moment I could smell Granmama's perfume, the perfume she only wore to church. She was resting in her yellow dress. The yellow dress that had yellow lace flowers over yellow satin, the dress that hung in her cedar wardrobe, the dress that she would put my hand on and say, "Flowers. Fl-ow-ers," and I would see in my mind the tall yellow sunflowers that had grown up among the weeds behind her house. I reached for her, but her hands were gray, not brown and pink, and her face was gray and dusty. She did not reach for me, and I did not know this woman in Granmama's dress. </p><p> On the train back to St. Louis I asked Mama, "When can we go back to Granmama's?" but she stared straight ahead, moving only when the train jostled her. I let go of her arm and braced myself as I crossed the aisle. My oldest brother, Lamont, pulled me up on his lap. At nine he seemed to understand things like a grown-up. I asked, "Where Deddy?" He answered me while looking out the window, "Who cares?" </p><p> "When we goin back to Granmama house?" In the reflection I didn't see his face change, but I put my hand on his cheek to turn it to me, and felt heat rise up to his temples. Warm tears rolled over my hand, and he mumbled, "Granmama's dead." I heard the voice of my big sister Towanda, the day she ran home and said, "There was a fight after school in dead man's alley," and Mama saying, "A nigga ain't worth a damn less he's dead." I saw Granmama's gray face and yellow dress lying among broken glass and candy wrappers, muddy storm water washing over her. I leaned against Lamont's chest and cried at the window too.<br> </p><p> I was always crying, and clinging to Mama like death would sneak up and take her away. Unlike my four older siblings, I always walked because running meant falling, and falling released blood, blood released tears, pain spewing up from some churning ulcer inside of me that nobody understood. People stopped blaming my fragile state on the fact that I was born in Mississippi one summer and was Granmama's favorite, and it hurt me more than the other kids when she died. Mama said, "She's always cried a lot." </p><p> Mama didn't seem to mind my constant tears unless we were at church or at a barbeque and one of the aunts commented, "Lord, that chile done sprung a leak again," then Mama would yank me out of the fray of flying baseballs, jump ropes, and drunk uncles, and say, "Don't be so damn sensitive, cryin over every little thing." Usually I cried softly for an additional hour, so none of the aunts would want to sit and talk to Mama, just like none of the kids wanted to play with me. </p><p> My oldest sister, Towanda, nicknamed me "cry baby-baby," because I was unlike my sisters and brothers, who had their legs planted firmly under them like young oaks with deep roots reaching beneath the asphalt. They ran up and down the streets of West St. Louis, falling and bruising without the slightest grimace. When Lamont dragged Towanda, Roscoe, and LaVern through the gangway in the red wagon, their ashy brown legs with dirty sneakers dangled. Their knees scraped against the brick of our house and the grainy tar-paper shingles of the neighbors' house -- their laughter louder than the pain of scabby knees.<br> </p><p> My mama could tell a story. Where Deddy didn't have much to say about his childhood, Mama made up for it with stories about hers. And when she told stories about something bad, she had a way of plugging a funny image in there, or throwing her head back in a big laugh with her gold tooth shining. The story about how she got that tooth was one of my favorites. </p><p> "I was in Bo's car flyin up to West Point to pick up my girlfriend.

This revolutionary work transforms the burgeoning interdisciplinary debate on emotion by suggesting, instead, a positive relation between the "death of the subject" and the very existence of emotion.</p><p>Reading the writings of Derrida and de Man--theorists often seen as emotionally contradictory and cold--Terada finds grounds for construing emotion as nonsubjective. This project offers fresh interpretations of deconstruction's most important texts, and of Continental and Anglo-American philosophers from Descartes to Deleuze and Dennett. At the same time, it revitalizes poststructuralist theory by deploying its methodologies in a new field, the philosophy of emotion, to reach a startling conclusion: if we really were subjects, we would have no emotions at all.</p><p>Engaging debates in philosophy, literary criticism, psychology, and cognitive science from a poststructuralist and deconstructive perspective, Terada's work is essential for the renewal of critical thought in our day.</p></p><p>Rei Terada is Professor of Comparative Literature &#xfeff;and Director of the Critical Theory Emphasis at the University of California, Irvine.&#x201c;What starts from a shrewd review of contemporary polemics goes on to take the shape of a theory of emotion of Terada&#x2019;s own, drawn from her analytical reading of post-structuralist writing and of earlier and present-day philosophies of emotion. With <i>Feeling in Theory</i> Terada has produced something excellent and major, both a contribution to post-structuralist theory and its interpretation, and a placing of it in a wider surround.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cynthia Chase, author of <i>Decomposing Figures</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Feeling in Theory</i> takes issue with the often-expressed view that postmodern culture in general, and post-structuralist theory in particular, is hostile to the idea&#x2015;and even to the very existence&#x2015;of emotion. Terada argues that what is at stake in these debates isn&#x2019;t really emotion per se, so much as it is the fate of the unified subject. An anxiety over postmodern notions of a foundering subjectivity is what actually underlies all these calls for a return to more conservative aesthetic positions. Emotion is invoked in polemics only because it is thought to be the ultimate guarantor of the subject&#x2019;s integrity; if there are feelings, the argument goes, then there must be a Self present to experience them. Terada shows, however, that this line of argument is deeply problematic, arguing startlingly but quite cogently that there is a fundamental contradiction between emotion or &#x2018;experience&#x2019; on the one hand, and the notion of a unified subjectivity on the other. It is not merely that emotion does not need to be grounded in a subject; but more strongly, that emotion requires the nonexistence of the subject, and that a subject as traditionally conceived could not possibly experience emotion. Terada therefore proposes to develop a post-structuralist theory of emotion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Shaviro, author of <i>Doom Patrols</i></b></p><h2>An Anthropology of Everyday Life</h2><p>The internationally renowned anthropologist describes his anthropological observations over the years and discusses the adventure, glory, pain, and disappointment of the first fifty years of his life. By the author of <i>The Silent Language.</i> 20,000 first printing.</p><p>"A delightfully readable odyssey of one of the most original and creative spirits of anthropology." -- Ashley Montagu<p></p><p>"An engaging, even charming, intellectual biography." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p>Of his life, anthropologist Hall (coauthor, Hidden Differences, 1987; The Dance of Life, 1982, etc.) says here, ``In the perspective of the years I can see that mine has been an unusual life--in fact, a remarkable one, endowed with luminosity.'' Hall, born in 1914, focuses in these appealing memoirs on his childhood through early midlife, tracing a personal evolution of ideas and ``self.'' He recalls many details of a past that ranges from his too-few years with his parents as the eldest of a brood of siblings, to his growing up among strangers at boarding schools in New Mexico, to time spent living with American Indians, serving in the US Army, and working in academia (Univ. of Denver and Bennington, where his ``best friend'' was Erich Fromm) and the federal government. His reminiscences wander a bit, and it's sometimes unclear why he's relating a particular anecdote--but, in a way, Hall's narrative mirrors the random quality of ``everyday life'' and the unexpected ways in which an inquisitive mind stumbles on insight, learns, and grows. Of particular interest are the glimpses he provides into the formation of a cultural anthropologist, and how he developed his pathbreaking ideas on nonverbal communication. The title pays homage to Freud--and, finally, Hall concludes that the ``anthropology of everyday life'' is akin to the therapeutic process: that, upon examination, our daily lives reveal ``the vast world of unconscious culture in its relation to the unconscious self.'' An engaging, even charming, intellectual biography. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It provides a fascinating record not only of the U.S. Navy&#39;s metamorphosis from a battleship-oriented to a carrier-centered fleet, but also of the heated debates that took place over the changing naval strategy. With an insider&#39;s grasp of the personalities involved, award-winning naval historian Clark G. Reynolds takes readers from the war rooms of Washington to the flight decks of the Pacific. He vividly describes the battles over the concept of fast carriers between the air admirals and battleship admirals and offers little-known details gleaned from personal interviews and private diaries.</p><p><b>Clark G. Reynolds,</b> was professor emeritus of the College of Charleston in South Carolina. He is also the author of <i>On the Warpath in the Pacific: Admiral Jocko Clark and the Fast Carriers</i> and <i>Admiral John H.

Adam Haines claims he&#39;s visiting the home of famous artist Phillip Fairchild to relax and paint. In actuality, he has been sent to investigate the whereabouts of a stolen painting.

If bestselling books are advising us to not think, LeGault argues, it comes as no surprise that sharp, incisive reasoning has become a lost art in the daily life of people everywhere. <br> <br> Somewhere along the line, the Age of Reason morphed into the Age of Emotion; this systemic erosion is costing time, money, jobs, and lives in the twenty-first century, leading to less fulfilment and growing dysfunction. LeGault provides a bold, controversial, and objective analysis of the causes and solutions for some of the biggest problems facing Western culture in the 21st century. From the over- load of reality TV shows and gossip magazines that have rendered curiosity of the mind and spirit obsolete to permissive parenting and low standards that have caused an academic crisis among our children, LeGault looks at all aspects of modern lives and points to how and where it all went wrong.</p><p><b>Michael R.

Sullivan inserted a blank piece of paper and typed: It was a dark and stormy night. He was just ten years old and mimicking the only writer he knew at the time...Charles Schultzs Snoopy. That spark ignited a flame and Michael's desire to fill blank pages would become a life-long obsession. As an adult, Michael spent more than ten years developing his craft by studying authors such as Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, and John Steinbeck. During that time, he wrote thirteen novels without finding any traction in publishing. Since insanity is repeating the same act but expecting a different result, he did the only sane thing he could think of and quit, vowing never to write creatively again.</p> <p>Never turned out to be too long for Michael and after a decade he returned to the keyboard in his forties...but with one condition: he wouldn't seek publication. Instead, he wrote a series of books that had been building in his head during his hiatus. His first reading love was fantasy, and his hope was to help foster a love of reading in his then thirteen-year-old daughter, who struggled due to severe dyslexia. After reading the third book of this series, his wife insisted the novels needed to ""get out there."" When Michael refused to jump back onto the query-go-round, she took over the publication tasks and has run ""the business side"" of his writing ever since.</p> <p>Michael is one of the few authors who has successfully published through all three routes: small press, self, and big five.

But complexity was that rococo master's stock-in-trade, which may explain why he returned to his native country in 1904 after an absence of more than 20 years. To be sure, he was interested in a Jamesian walk down memory lane, with its full quota of meditative hairsplitting. Yet he also meant to take advantage of his hybrid status as a Europeanized American. "I made no scruple," James explains in his introduction, "of my conviction that I should understand and should care better and more than the most earnest of visitors, and yet that I should vibrate with more curiosity ... than the pilgrim with the longest list of questions." Vibrate he did, in the ornate and extraordinary periods of his late phase, and the result was a one-of-a-kind travel book, <i>The American Scene</i>.<p> James opens his book with an impressionistic overture, which can be slightly off-putting: he seems too intent on leaping beyond the dry <i>donn�e</i> of American life into pure abstraction. But readers shouldn't be discouraged. Even in the opening pages the author manages some brilliant snapshots, like this description of New Hampshire's Saco River: "The rich, full lapse of the river, the perfect brownness, clear and deep, as of liquid agate, in its wide swirl, the large indifferent ease in its pace and motion, as of some great benevolent institution smoothly working; all this, with the sense of the deepening autumn about, gave I scarce know what pastoral nobleness to the scene, something raising it out of the reach of even the most restless of analysts." And once James begins his journey proper up and down the Eastern seaboard, he delivers one amazing page after another. He doesn't, of course, care for everything he sees--the skyscrapers of Manhattan strike him as vertical monstrosities, and he lets loose with more than one politically incorrect shaft at the minority population.</p><p> What appalls him the most, though, is the Almighty Dollar, which he perceives as "the preliminary American postulate," the very bedrock of New World life: "This basis is that of active pecuniary gain and of active pecuniary gain only--that of one's making the conditions so triumphantly pay that the prices, the manners, the other inconveniences, take their place as a friction it is comparatively easy to salve, wounds directly treatable with the wash of gold." Some will argue that the fussbudget author had spent too much time in England, where <i>money</i> remained a dirty word until after the Second World War. Others may find his diagnosis eerily prescient. In any case, <i>The American Scene</i> remains required reading for anybody interested in U.S. history, Henry James, or the incredible evolution of the compound sentence. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><b>Henry James</b> (1843-1916), born in New York City, was the son of noted religious philosopher Henry James, Sr., and brother of eminent psychologist and philosopher William James. He spent his early life in America and studied in Geneva, London and Paris during his adolescence to gain the worldly experience so prized by his father. He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<p>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>. Late in 1875 he settled in Paris, where he met Turgenev, Flaubert, and Zola, and wrote <b>The American</b> (1877). In December 1876 he moved to London, where two years later he achieved international fame with <b>Daisy Miller</b>. Other famous works include <b>Washington Square</b> (1880), <b>The Portrait of a Lady</b> (1881), <b>The Princess Casamassima</b> (1886), <b>The Aspern Papers</b> (1888), <b>The Turn of the Screw</b> (1898), and three large novels of the new century, <b>The Wings of the Dove</b> (1902), <b>The Ambassadors</b> (1903) and <b>The Golden Bowl</b> (1904). In 1905 he revisited the United States and wrote <b>The American Scene</b> (1907).</p><p>During his career he also wrote many works of criticism and travel. Although old and ailing, he threw himself into war work in 1914, and in 1915, a few months before his death, he became a British subject. In 1916 King George V conferred the Order of Merit on him. He died in London in February 1916.</p></p><h2>Human Rights: A Political and Cultural Critique (Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights)</h2><p><p>In 1948 the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and with it a profusion of norms, processes, and institutions to define, promote, and protect human rights. Today virtually every cause seeks to cloak itself in the righteous language of rights. But even so, this universal reliance on the rights idiom has not succeeded in creating common ground and deep agreement as to the scope, content, and philosophical bases for human rights.</p><p>Makau Mutua argues that the human rights enterprise inappropriately presents itself as a guarantor of eternal truths without which human civilization is impossible. Mutua contends that in fact the human rights corpus, though well meaning, is a Eurocentric construct for the reconstitution of non-Western societies and peoples with a set of culturally biased norms and practices.</p><p>Mutua maintains that if the human rights movement is to succeed, it must move away from Eurocentrism as a civilizing crusade and attack on non-European peoples. Only a genuine multicultural approach to human rights can make it truly universal. Indigenous, non-European traditions of Asia, Africa, the Pacific, and the Americas must be deployed to deconstruct&#x2014;and to reconstruct&#x2014;a universal bundle of rights that all human societies can claim as theirs.</p></p><p>Makau Mutua is Professor of Law and Director of the Human Rights Center at the State University of New York at Buffalo Law School.<p>"A welcome and timely contribution to a human rights discourse that is becoming increasingly monolithic. Mutua is right when he argues that the human rights movement is neither nonideological nor postideological. The mantra of universal morality tends to mask its deeply political character."&#x2014;<i>Ethics and International Affairs</i></p><br><br><p>"Engaged, sometimes passionate. . . .

Will it be with a family of sheep, or a questioning owl, or maybe some playful fox cubs? Or will his search lead him somewhere else? From the screen to the page, <i>Elliot Gets Lost </i>will bring the fun and heartwarming story of a lost puppy to readers of all ages. Seen in the 2016 movie Pete's Dragon as one of Pete's prized possessions, the picture book was brought to the page by the film's creative team, and features never-before-seen illustrations. Fans of the movie and picture books alike will love this story of a young puppy's journey.</p><p><p><b>David Lowery</b> moved to Texas when he was seven years old and has been writing and making movies there ever since.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p><b>Toby Halbrooks</b> was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

His love of illustration came from his early exposure to Herg�'s <i>Tintin </i>series, classic children's books, and great art museums. </p>PreS-Gr 2-A beautiful book that&#39;s not a tie-in to the movie Pete&#39;s Dragon but an original story and an element within the movie itself. Elliot is a small puppy going on a car trip and camping adventure with his family of Little Boy, Mom, and Dad. But when he gets overexcited and knocks over the tent, he runs into the woods in shame and quickly gets lost. Several forest animals come to Elliot&#39;s aid but reiterate, &#34;You need to find your family.&#34; Indeed, Elliot misses his family, who are waiting somewhere outside the woods. As dusk falls, he howls at the North Star in despair. The forest animals join together to help Elliot get back to his Little Boy and the campsite that night, the place that is &#34;right where he belongs.&#34; This tale is unique for its prominent placement in the movie as Pete&#39;s only treasured reminder of his parents and his past. The movie&#39;s plot is also suggestively mirrored by the book&#39;s story, with dialogue and illustrations directly referencing scenes from the movie. Yet this title can still be enjoyed on its own merit. VERDICT The story is well written in spare text perfect for reading aloud, with charming, folk art-inspired illustrations. Guaranteed to be a great bedtime selection with broad appeal both on its own and in conjunction with the movie.-Jessica Bushore, Xenia, OH</p><h2>Top Secret Recipes Lite!</h2><p><b>#1 bestselling Top Secret Recipes series with more than 4 million books sold!&nbsp;</b><br><br>With health-consciousness sweeping America, many of us feel we can no longer indulge in the tasty but guilt-inducing foods we grew up with. <b>Todd Wilbur</b>, who made a name for himself by allowing us to clone treats such as Oreos&#x2122;and Outback Steakhouse� Blooming Onions&#x2122;in our own kitchens, now gives us back our cherished foods with reduced fat and calories.

One story at a time.<i> Red</i> traces Williams&#x2019;s lifelong love of and commitment to the desert, as she explores what draws us to a place and keeps us there. It brings together the lyrical evocations of Coyote&#x2019;s Canyon and Desert Quartet with new essays of great power and originality, essays that range from a family discussion on the desert tortoise to an investigation of slowness to startling encounters with Anasazi artifacts (including a ceremonial sash made of scarlet macaw feathers).<br><br>Pursuing the question of why America&#x2019;s redrock wilderness matters to the soul of this country, <i>Red</i> bridges the divide between the political and the poetic and shows how this harshest and most fragile of landscapes inspires a soulful return to &#x201c;wild mercy.&#x201d; The preservation of wildness is not simply a political process but a spiritual one. <br><br>With grace, humor, and the subtleties of her perception, Williams reminds us of what we have forgotten in the chaos of our lives and what can be reclaimed in the stillness of the desert. <br><i><br>Red</i> is further proof that the writings of Terry Tempest Williams possess a revelatory power and an emotional intelligence at once rare and authentic.</p><p>As a lifelong desert dweller, Terry Tempest Williams is intimately familiar with the multiple shades of red, and she explores many of them, among other things, in this tribute to the desert and canyon country of southern Utah that she holds so dear. In this collection of essays, poems, congressional testimony, and journal entries (some previously published), she ruminates on the meaning of wilderness and the need to preserve it as a way to save ourselves as much as the land itself. In <i>Red</i>, she lends an elegant and passionate voice to the growing "Coyote Clan" in southern Utah--"hundreds, maybe even thousands, of individuals who are quietly subversive on behalf of the land"--along with the many others ideologically in step with this movement. She also discusses those deeply resentful of active environmentalists as well as those seething at the U.S. government for the way it manages millions of acres of western land, writing that "Federal control in the American West remains an open wound." Some of these contrary voices even come from within her own clan, a reality she describes in an essay in which she gently debates the merits of the Endangered Species Act with her father and other family members who own and operate a construction company in Utah. <p> A beloved nature writer and environmental voice, Williams writes emotionally and even erotically of her relationship with the red-rock landscape surrounding her home outside Moab, closely analyzing the wildlife, human characters, and Anasazi petroglyphs of this magical, arid region. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>&#x201c;Lush elegies to the wilderness. . . .

The only planet that seems to be spared is Grass, so-called because that is virtually all that grows there. It was settled by families of European nobility who live on vast estancias and indulge in the ancient sport of fox hunting--although the horses, hounds and foxes aren't what they what they appear to be. Rigo and Marjorie Westriding Yrarier and family are sent to Grass as ambassadors and unofficial investigators because the ruling families--the bons--have refused to allow scientists to authenticate the planet's immunity from the plague. The egotistical Rigo sets out to prove himself to the bons while Marjorie remains wary about the relationship between the hunters and the hunted. She gains allies in her search, but invasion strikes from an unexpected quarter before the truth about an alien species comes to light.

Jones has an extensive background in metaphysics, cutting edge science and the paranormal. She currently serves as a Consultant and Director of Special Projects for ARPAST, the Arkansas Paranormal and Anomalous Studies Team, where she works with ARPAST President and co-author Larry Flaxman to develop theories that can tested in the field. Marie has been featured on the History Channel's "Nostradamus Effect" series, and served as a special UFO/abduction consultant for the 2009 Universal Pictures science fiction movie, "The Fourth Kind." <br> Larry Flaxman has been actively involved in paranormal research and hands-on field investigation for over thirteen years, and melds his technical, scientific, and investigative backgrounds together for no-nonsense, scientifically objective explanations regarding a variety of anomalous phenomena. He is the President and Senior Researcher of ARPAST, the Arkansas Paranormal and Anomalous Studies Team, which he founded in February of 2007. Larry is also active in the development of cutting edge custom designed equipment for use in the field investigating environmental effects and anomalies that may contribute to our understanding of the paranormal.Author Jones (Supervolcano, 2013: The End of Days or a New Beginning?) and paranormal researcher Flaxman address the "cosmic significance" of specific codes, patterns and numbers-in particular recurring numbers like the "time prompt" 11:11-that call attention to a "separate level of awareness, consciousness, or reality." Jones and Flaxman comb facts and statistics for enticing examples; a long list attached to 9/11 includes the facts that the first plane to strike the towers was Flight 11; New York is the 11 th state; and Bin Laden's birthplace, Saudi Arabia, has 11 letters. They also look at "magical" numbers and curiosities in math, science and religion. (Pi, Apery's Constant, the Hebrew Kaballah, etc.) Jones and Flaxman are rational investigators with a game attitude and a willingness to believe; to be fair, they also look to human psychology (the tendency toward pattern-seeking) and "laws" (like the Law of Truly Large Numbers) that indicate "each of us should be experiencing some strange, coincidental events... even potentially miraculous, every single day." Whether readers will come to believe that numbers are "as paranormal as ghosts or UFOs" will largely depend on their attitude toward those two subjects; nevertheless, the authors' case makes an entertaining numerical romp. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet for all their foibles and flaws, they proved to be tough survivors, far outlasting classical Greece itself. In Egypt, the Olympian gods claimed to have given birth to pharaohs; in Rome, they led respectable citizens into orgiastic rituals of drink and sex. Under Christianity and Islam they survived as demons, allegories, and planets; and in the Renaissance, they triumphantly emerged as ambassadors of a new, secular belief in humanity. Their geographic range, too, has been little short of astounding: in their exile, the gods and goddesses of Olympus have traveled east to the walls of cave temples in China and west to colonize the Americas. They snuck into Italian cathedrals, haunted Nietzsche, and visited Borges in his restless dreams.</p><p>In a lively, original history, Barbara Graziosi offers the first account to trace the wanderings of these protean deities through the millennia. Drawing on a wide range of literary and archaeological sources, <i>The Gods of Olympus</i> opens a new window on the ancient world, religion, mythology, and its lasting influence.</p></p><p><b>Barbara Graziosi</b> is the author of <i>Inventing Homer</i> and <i>Homer in the Twentieth Century</i>, among other works. In 2011, she provided the introduction and notes for a new translation of the <i>Iliad</i> for Oxford World's Classics. A professor of classics at Durham University, Graziosi is also a contributor to <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>, the <i>London Review of Books</i>, and BBC radio programs on the arts. <i>The Gods of Olympus</i> is her first trade book. She lives in the U.K.<p>1</p> <p>At Home in Greece</p> <p>Tall, broad, and covered in snow for much of the year, Mount Olympus stands alone, fully visible from every side. It dominates the landscape for miles; its dazzling peaks seem particularly incongruous when viewed from the hot, low plains around. From the sea, the mountain sometimes looks like a cloud.</p> <p>In antiquity, Mount Olympus lay very much off the beaten track. People had little reason to go near it, and no incentive at all to climb it, but they could see it&#x2014;and in turn they felt observed. The Greeks thought that the gods lived among the mountain&#x2019;s peaks and watched what happened down below. Poets elaborated on this notion. Homer described Mount Olympus precisely, mentioning its &#x201c;many summits,&#x201d; &#x201c;abundant snow,&#x201d; and &#x201c;steepness&#x201d; and giving an indication of just where it was. At the same time, he suggested that this mythical residence of the gods was not quite what it seemed: &#x201c;Olympus is never shaken by winds, hit by rain, or covered in snow; cloudless ether spreads around it, and a bright aura encircles it.&#x201d;1 So Olympus was both a particular landmark and a place of the mind. Greek communities could see the mountain, agree about its sacredness, and feel united by a shared sense of landscape; but they were also reminded that the gods did not live in our world and were never subjected to the indignities of bad weather.</p> <p>It is unclear when the mountain first became associated with the gods. In the poems of Homer, the most important deities are explicitly called &#x201c;the Olympians,&#x201d; but he was not necessarily the first to place them on the sacred mountain. The <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey,</i> in the form in which we have them, date to the archaic period (roughly the eighth to the sixth century BC), and the Greek peninsula was settled long before that time. We can reconstruct, on linguistic grounds, that the Greeks were descended from speakers of a language also related to Sanskrit and Latin as well as to Germanic, Slavic, and other linguistic groups, and which is conventionally called &#x201c;Indo-European.&#x201d; Migrating from central Asia, Indo-European speakers gradually settled in Europe and introduced broadly shared notions of the gods. So, for example, the Greek Zeus is related to the Sanskrit Dy�us Pitar: they are both versions of the same supreme god, ruler of the sky. It is unsurprising that in Greece, this Indo-European god settled on Mount Olympus, the tallest landmark in the area. It is more difficult to establish just when this happened. Answering that question requires dating the Indo-European migrations and investigating the roots of Homeric epic&#x2014;both of which are controversial subjects.</p> <p>Impressive civilizations were already flourishing in Greece around 2000 BC, more than a thousand years before Homer&#x2019;s time. Monumental remains at Mycenae, Tiryns, and Pylos testify to this. In the twelfth century BC, however, these civilizations suddenly collapsed. A long period of decline followed, generally known as the Greek &#x201c;Dark Ages.&#x201d; It was only in the eighth century BC that people living in Greece began to flourish again. The next two centuries were characterized by a sharp increase in the population, the rise of the city-state (<i>polis</i>), the construction of the first temples and cult statues of the gods, an upsurge in travel and trade, the foundation of new colonies, the reintroduction of writing (a technology that had been lost during the Dark Ages), and the phenomenal spread of epic poetry. Scholars used to think that the Dark Ages corresponded with the arrival of Indo-European tribes from Asia. The impressive archaeological remains at Mycenae and elsewhere were thought to predate that migration, and therefore have nothing to do with Zeus and the rest of the Indo-European pantheon. The many written tablets found at the Mycenaean sites were assumed to record a language unrelated to Greek, perhaps an early form of Etruscan. This theory crumbled spectacularly in the 1950s, when Michael Ventris and John Chadwick (who had worked as a code breaker during World War II) managed to decipher Linear B, the script of the Mycenaean tablets. To widespread amazement, they proved that the tablets actually recorded an early form of Greek.2 This made it clear that Indo-European people had been living in Greece long before the Dark Ages and suggested that they worshipped essentially the same gods as later Greek communities, even though they did not have temples housing cult statues. Archaeologists had obviously misdated the Indo-European migration on the basis of the material record. This dramatic realization gave classicists hope of finding some snippets of Greek poetry among the Linear B tablets, perhaps early versions of Homeric epic describing the Olympian pantheon. In fact, they discovered nothing of the kind: as far as we can tell, Linear B was used exclusively for matter-of-fact lists and inventories. Mount Olympus never featured, nor did any stories about divine doings. Still, by recording sacrifices and other offerings to particular gods, even the dry documents of Mycenaean bureaucracy did reveal some surprising facts.</p> <p>Tablets from Pylos and Crete indicate, for instance, that Dionysos was already known in the second millennium BC. Homer barely mentioned him, and later Greek texts presented him as a newcomer to Greece, a recent import from the decadent East&#x2014;but this was evidently not so. We now know that Dionysos was always considered a &#x201c;new&#x201d; and subversive god in need of recognition, no matter how long he had actually been worshipped in Greece.3 His youth and exoticism are a matter of personality rather than historical age. Homer must have kept Dionysos out of Olympus not because he barely knew this god, as was once supposed, but because he was all too aware of his characteristics: Dionysos would have spoiled the party on Olympus with his drunken excesses. Linear B tablets produced other surprises, too. The god Apollo, for example, was apparently unknown to the Mycenaeans. This &#x201c;most Greek of the gods,&#x201d; as a famous Hellenist called him, this paragon of beauty and measure, was in fact a rather late addition to the Greek pantheon, had no obvious Indo-European credentials, and was at least partly Semitic in influence, identified early on with the Canaanite god Resheph.4</p> <p>There were, then, some differences between Mycenaean portrayals of the gods and their later appearance in archaic Greece&#x2014;but there were also some definite connections and some suggestive echoes of old Mycenaean rituals in Homeric poetry. In the <i>Odyssey,</i> for instance, Poseidon receives special worship at Pylos in the Peloponnese, and that is precisely where most of the Linear B tablets concerning his cult have been found. Likewise, Hera is called &#x201c;ox-eyed&#x201d; in Homer, and Linear B tablets reveal that she had received rich cattle sacrifices from Mycenaean worshippers, richer even than those offered to Zeus. Perhaps early Greek speakers had looked right into the eyes of their sacrificial victims and seen in them a shadow of the goddess. Their impression was then passed on through the formulations of ritual and poetic language: <i>ox-eyed Hera</i> became a standard Homeric phrase. Beyond such poetic links, there was also an entirely solid aspect of continuity between the civilizations of the Bronze Age and archaic Greece: buildings. In the archaic period, people could still see the remnants of impressive fortifications at Mycenae, Pylos, and&#x2014;most important&#x2014;Troy, on the coast of Turkey, a city that had once been a Hittite protectorate. The Greeks wove stories around those ruins, imagining the great heroes who had once lived and died there. In the case of particularly impressive remains, such as the walls of Troy, it was even suggested that the gods themselves had built them.</p> <p>One of the most remarkable features of archaic Greek poetry is how insistently, and precisely, it places its tales of gods and heroes in the Aegean landscape. It is as if, in the sudden explosion of travel and trade that characterized the archaic period, people wanted to exchange stories not only about their gods, but about landmarks, ruins, and sailing routes. Homer described the whole eastern Aegean, mentioning hundreds of place-names, in a massive Catalogue of Ships in the second book of the <i>Iliad</i>. Hesiod, in his <i>Theogony,</i> revealed how the gods were born and simultaneously placed them on a map. Zeus grew up in Crete, he said; Aphrodite came out of the waves near Cyprus. As well as listening to poems about divine travel, the Greeks were increasingly prepared to travel themselves in order to worship the gods. According to our ancient sources, the first Olympics took place in 776 BC. Athletes, dancers, poets, and musicians from many different Greek city-states gathered to compete against one another at the small village of Olympia, probably so named after the residence of Zeus. The games were put on precisely as a spectacle for Zeus, but they also attracted enthusiastic human crowds. At roughly the same time, the Delphic oracle opened for business, delivering Apollo&#x2019;s prophecies to all who made the journey to it. Soon, Delphi also started to host competitions in athletics and poetry, in order to make sure that Apollo did not miss out on the celebrations his father enjoyed elsewhere. Crisscrossing the Aegean in poetry and sailing ships alike, the Greeks took possession of the landscape and placed their gods in it.</p> <p>The <i>Homeric Hymn to Apollo,</i> a beautiful archaic poem telling the story of Leto&#x2019;s search for a place to give birth, illustrates the process. After nine days of travel and labor, Leto finally delivers Artemis and Apollo on the barren island of Delos, holding on to a palm tree. A sanctuary is built near the sacred palm, and worshippers begin to visit the island, bringing their offerings and gifts. Rewarded for its kindness to the pregnant goddess, Delos becomes rich, despite its rocky soil. The island also sets a pattern for the cult of Apollo: when the god grows up, the <i>Hymn</i> continues, he travels to another daunting place, &#x201c;a cliff hanging below Mount Parnassos, and a rugged glade below.&#x201d; There, at Delphi, Apollo defeats a snakelike monster called Python and decides to build a second temple for himself, where he will deliver oracles to inquiring mortals.</p> <p>The poem tells us that Apollo needs priests for his inhospitable sanctuary at Delphi and, while considering the problem, &#x201c;becomes aware of a swift ship on the wine-dark sea,&#x201d; sailing hundreds of miles away between Knossos and Pylos. Deciding to turn the Cretan crew into his priests, he transforms himself into a dolphin and leaps into the ship, rocking it fearfully as the Cretan sailors struggle in vain to catch him and throw him overboard. Terrified, they sail past Pylos, their destination, and farther north until the wind bends their course eastward, into the Gulf of Corinth, and they are finally stranded at Krisa, near modern Itea. There Apollo suddenly reveals himself in a shower of sparks. He tells the Cretan sailors that they must abandon their trade, climb the mountain looming above the coast, and tend to his newly founded sanctuary. They will make a good living, he adds, despite their unlikely location, because pilgrims will provide a constant supply of gifts.</p> <p>It seems that the actual priests who worked at the sanctuary in Delphi really did claim Cretan descent and explained their life hundreds of miles from their ancestral home by telling the story of Apollo the dolphin. Strange as their tale may seem, it captured the spirit of the age. Everybody was on the move in the archaic period. Trade flourished, new cities were founded, and communal worship became part of a quickly expanding economy. The <i>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</i> mentions scores of place-names when describing the journeys of the Cretan sailors, Apollo, and his mother, Leto, thus offering a virtual tour of the ancient Greek world (see map on p. 23). Modern readers struggle to locate all the ancient toponyms and can easily get bored; but archaic Greek audiences must have been thrilled, for they recognized their own hometowns and landscapes and realized that they all played a role in the biography of the god. It was through such stories that Greek speakers began to realize that they belonged together and inhabited the same world. In the fifth century BC, Herodotus claimed that Greekness was a matter of &#x201c;common blood and language, shared temples of the gods, rituals, and common habits.&#x201d;5 Panhellenic centers of cult like Delphi and Olympia were of cardinal importance precisely because they helped to establish the &#x201c;common habits&#x201d; of the Greeks.</p> <p>For modern tourists, visiting Delphi remains one of the most effective ways of experiencing that ancient sense of Greekness, that early connection between place, poetry, and religion. It is best to approach the sanctuary from the sea&#x2014;as Apollo and his priests did, according to the <i>Hymn,</i> and as ancient worshippers arrived in real life. From the coast near Itea, the ancient sanctuary looks like a tiny white speck of marble against the dark cliffs of Mount Parnassos. The ascent is sharp and difficult, but those who follow the country road as it snakes up the mountain are amply rewarded. Up in Delphi, the view is spectacular and the air bracing, crystal-clear; just to be there is a spiritual experience, even today. To the south there are open views of blue mountains and a wide-open valley filled with a sea of silvery olive trees. Beyond them, the actual sea glitters, bright blue, in the distance. When one turns north, the outlook changes sharply: up close a sheer rock face looms over visitors, and beyond it rise the twin peaks of Mount Parnassos. The cliffs and crags seem impenetrable, but right there is where the <i>Hiera Hodos</i> starts, the ancient Sacred Way that leads through the sanctuary of Apollo up to the temple where his oracles were delivered.</p> <p>The sanctuary complex is built on narrow terraces cut into the steep mountainside, exploiting the small space to the full. Inside the sanctuary, the Sacred Way climbs upward, making two hairpin bends. The remains of elaborate buildings crowd it on both sides, so that visitors are constantly confronted with unexpected sights. This must have been even more true in ancient times, when intact structures would have impeded an overview of the sanctuary. Clustered around the entrance were once many life-size statues raised on pedestals, commemorating assorted wars between Greek city-states&#x2014;Tegea&#x2019;s victory over Sparta, for example, and Sparta&#x2019;s victory over Athens. A few statues also celebrated peaceful activities: the people of Corfu, for instance, set up a large bronze bull in thanksgiving for an extraordinary catch of tuna. After the statues, a little higher up, the Sacred Way was flanked by small, room-size shrines, or &#x201c;treasuries,&#x201d; built by individual city-states to house their votive offerings to Apollo. There were once thirty or more treasuries, and judging from those best preserved, they were exquisite. The Athenians built theirs on one of the best plots, a small triangular terrace just after the first sharp turn. It stood at an angle from the road, showing off both side and front to everyone as they went up and presenting a dramatic sight to those descending as well. The treasury was built entirely of Parian marble and had a beautiful frieze running all around it. The Athenians were probably trying to outdo the intricate treasury built just down the road by the people of Siphnos, but it is not clear that they succeeded. The Siphnian shrine, with its two beautiful sculpted women holding up the roof as if they were columns, is hard to surpass. The treasuries exemplified the competitive stance of ancient Greek city-states but also revealed a sense of common purpose, showing that all cities and communities paid...</p></p><h2>Crested Butte: From Coal Camp to Ski Town</h2><p>Like many old mountain mining communities, Crested Butte began life in the feverous excitement of a Colorado gold and silver mining camp, only to see the rich discoveries quickly disappear. However, unlike so many communities that became ghost towns, Crested Butte switched to mining the huge local deposits of top-quality coal. Through both good times and bad, the coal mining was carried on until the 1950s. Then Crested Butte slid quickly into "ghost town" status, only to be revived by the ski industry in the 1960s and 1970s. <p>Certainly the coal mining industry is an unusual partner for a Colorado ski town, but for Crested Butte, coal and skiing are inseparably intertwined. Crested Butte is the story of poor immigrants, labor strife, dirty and extremely dangerous coal mining, the D&amp;RG Railroad, and two rich and greedy companies called the Durango Trust and Colorado Fuel and Iron. Duane Smith illustrates how such a mixture can make for an amazing tale of intrigue, joy, and sorrow. As Smith puts it: "Americans tend to make legends out of things they want to believe.

Berry-stained bandit Jamie Lockhart steals pioneer wilderness planter Clement Musgrove&#39;s beautiful daughter, Rosamond, away from a home dominated by his ugly, evil second wife, Salome. These and other characters are gathered together in a tale at once acid and gentle, wise and lighthearted, woven as much from the rough homespun of American history as the gossamer thread of fairy stories.EUDORA WELTY (1909-2001) was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and attended the Mississippi State College for Women, the University of Wisconsin, and Columbia University (where she studied advertising).

Brynner took pictures of his family, the occupants of the refugee camps he visited as Special Consultant to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his friends and colleagues in the film world. His success as a photographer rested not so much on technical skill as on a gift for putting his subjects at ease, with the result that he could capture Cecil B. DeMille at a private mountain retreat in California where few photographers were allowed; Elizabeth Taylor, who never let anyone else photograph her off the set or without makeup, in a pool with her daughter; Ingrid Bergman and Deborah Kerr relaxing between takes; a radiant Mia Farrow cradling her enormous stomach a week before she gave birth to twins. In her brief introduction, Victoria Brynner writes of her close relationship with her father, from whom she gained her love of photography, and she includes brief comments by many of the famous friends who trusted and respected him enough to allow him to shoot these intriguing pictures. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.The actor who made baldness sexy was also an accomplished photographer. Compulsive, too, he stashed a camera behind his throne or in his chariot while playing the pharaoh in <i>The Ten Commandments</i> (1956), so he could snap away "during rehearsals or while waiting for a scene to begin." This album shows off his talent most winningly. Many of the images are candid portraits of the rich and renowned; outstanding among them are those of that whimsical ham of an artist, Jean Cocteau; of tiny Ron Howard striking muscle poses on the set of his first movie in 1958; and of virtually all the women, for what Roddy McDowall says in one of the many appreciative remarks sprinkled throughout the book seems true: "He was wonderful with women--they all felt safe with him." As warm is the handful of pictures of refugee children and elderly that Brynner took while serving as a special consultant to the UN in 1959. Loving and lovely. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Adventure of Missionary Heroism</h2><p>Among the annals of missionary service around the world are countless true stories of intrepid men and women who are little known today but who endured innumerable dangers, toils, tragedies, and triumphs for the sake of the Gospel.

Aptly illustrating Putnam&#x2019;s willingness to revisit and revise past arguments, they contain important new insights and freshly illuminate formulations that will be familiar to students of his work: his rejection of the idea that an absolute conception of the world is obtainable; his criticism of a nihilistic view of ethics that claims to be scientifically based; his pathbreaking distinction between sensations and apperceptions; and his use of externalist semantics to invalidate certain forms of skepticism. Above all, <i>Naturalism, Realism, and Normativity</i> reflects Putnam&#x2019;s thinking on how to articulate a theory of naturalism which acknowledges that normative phenomena form an ineluctable part of human experience, thereby reconciling scientific and humanistic views of the world that have long appeared incompatible.</p></p><p><p>Hilary Putnam was Cogan University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University.</p><p>Mario De Caro is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Universit� Roma Tre.</p>&#x201c;<b>Putnam</b>&#x2019;s writing in these essays is characteristically engaging, brilliant, and insightful, and as refreshing and instructive to read as ever.

He is Regent's Professor Emeritus at St. John's University, Minnesota.<br><br>Jon Hassler is Regent's Professor Emeritus at St. John's University, Minnesota.Because Agatha McGee's penmanship had become shaky with age, she relied on her younger friend Janet Meers to do her handwriting for her.<br><br>"Janet, are you coming into town today?" she asked over the telephone. "I have some invitations I'd like you to copy out for me and address the envelopes."<br><br>"Sure, what time?"<br><br>"Before two. Lillian comes over at two."<br><br>"I can come at eleven or one; take your pick."<br><br>"Come at eleven; we'll have lunch."<br><br>"Good, I'll bring sandwiches and soup."<br><br>Agatha protested, but not enough, fortunately, to sway Janet.<br><br>"What kind of sandwich would you like?" asked Janet.<br><br>"Tuna fish. But not in a bagel. Bagels are so hard to chew."<br><br>"Tuna on rye and bean soup. How's that?"<br><br>"That will be fine."<br><br>"What are the invitations for? Are you throwing a party?"<br><br>"I am, as a matter of fact."<br><br>A squeal of delight-"Oh, good!" Then, "Are Randy and I invited?"<br><br>"Never mind. You'll see when you get here."<br><br>Janet drove in from her split-level house on a scenic, wooded bend of the Badbattle River east of town. It was a lovely spring day. Birds were kicking up a racket in the lime-green woods, and the roadsides were purple with violets. She entered town on the high end and coasted downhill to the Badbattle, noticing how harshly the sun lay across the sidewalks and doorways now that the elms had mostly been taken down. Everything-the lawns, the houses, the people out walking-seemed overexposed to the sky. Here and there an elm remained standing, but dying, partly dismantled by wind and woodpeckers, a stark and ugly monument to the shaded and graceful past.<br><br>She parked in front of Agatha's large white house that sat on the highest lot on River Street. She was glad to see that Agatha's nephew, Frederick Lopat, had finally finished repairing the shoulder-high retaining wall that kept her front yard from spilling into the street. She was pleased, too, having climbed the steps to the yard, to see that he had raked the grass and readied the small flower beds for the annuals he'd plant in a few weeks after the threat of frost was past. This morning he was painting the wrought-iron railing leading up to the front porch.<br><br>"Hi, Fredriko."<br><br>He turned to her with his customary nod and crooked smile, a paint brush in one hand, a small can of black Rust-Oleum in the other. He was a tall, pale, stoop-shouldered man in his fifties. His "Hi, Janet" was barely audible.<br><br>"Not working today?" she asked.<br><br>"I got plenty work around here."<br><br>"I mean in Willoughby."<br><br>"Nope, Saturday's my day off."<br><br>She held up the lunch bag she'd brought. "I've got your favorite here, ham and cheese."<br><br>"Good, thanks," he mumbled, and turned back to work.<br><br>She climbed to the wide front porch and pressed the doorbell.<br><br>"The bell's on the blink again," said Frederick. "Go ahead on in."<br><br>She did so, calling Agatha's name. There was no response. She called again, crossing the living room, and once again in the dining room. It occurred to her that Agatha may be dead. She glanced into the sunroom, then pushed open the swinging door into the kitchen with trepidation, half expecting to find Agatha, in her eightieth year, collapsed on the floor. She wasn't in the kitchen, but Janet shuddered anyhow, recalling the days before the flood when she had this expectation every time she approached this house. Before the flood Agatha didn't look well. She didn't act well. She spent whole days in her chair by the front window, brooding and watching the occasional car or pedestrian go by. The flood woke her up. The flood and her new pacemaker. The change was miraculous. She came out of the ordeal looking even smaller and more fretful than she had before, but a lot of her old energy came back, her erect posture, her strong voice, her fiery opinions.<br><br>Janet noticed the door to the enclosed back porch standing slightly ajar, and she found Agatha on the back stoop shaking out her dust mop. The woman seemed to have shrunk since she last saw her a month ago. Janet's daughter Sara, when she was in the fifth grade, was as tall as Agatha was now. She turned quickly to Janet, a sparkle of good humor in her small, lively eyes, because the sight of Janet always made her glad, and said, "Ah, there you are. Isn't it a perfect day? The sun actually is sending us down some warmth."<br><br>Bending to give the old woman a peck on the cheek, Janet agreed. "Spring is early this year. Most of our snow has already disappeared."<br><br>Agatha took her arm. "Yes, and the first thing I heard this morning was a pair of wrens. I came out here to verify it and saw one of them, so I've stopped worrying that winter might come back." She went on about birds while looking Janet over. She was pleased to see her hair cut short, no wrinkles yet except smile lines around her clear, steady eyes, and the frown mark in her forehead, the latter doubtless caused by worry concerning her husband, Randy, whom Agatha had never entirely approved of.<br>"I thought they were orioles at first but orioles are cautious travelers, you know. They wait until it's completely safe before they come north and set up housekeeping."<br><br>With her eyes on the house across the alley, Janet said, "Lillian's place is still empty."<br><br>"It's not fit to live in. Because of the flood, you know."<br><br>"But that was almost a year ago. You mean it hasn't been repaired yet?"<br><br>"Nothing's been done. Empty ever since Imogene moved out. It's becoming an eyesore."<br><br>Lillian Kite's unmarried daughter, Imogene, as Janet knew, managed the local Carnegie Library. After the flood she had locked up the house and moved into a condo downtown. "Wouldn't you think they'd sell it?"<br><br>"It's not theirs to sell. It was usurped by the county commissioners months ago. They intended to sell it. To pay for Lillian's room at the Sunset Senior Home. But of course nobody wants damaged goods."<br><br>They stood there silent for a time, Janet's face raised to the warm sunshine, Agatha gazing at the house across the alley, recalling how, as a child, she used to watch for Lillian Kite out her kitchen window (this was before the back porch was added on). Lillian was Agatha's first and lifelong friend. Lillian's third birthday party was Agatha's first social occasion. She remembered how her anticipation turned to anxiety when she discovered Lillian's house full of three- and four-year-olds she'd never seen before. From the corners of rooms Agatha watched them screaming, wrestling, bursting balloons, and gorging themselves on popcorn and cake. Where did all these strangers come from and why was Lillian paying more attention to them than she was to Agatha? She cried. Mrs. Kite sent word to Agatha's mother and she came and took her home.<br><br>But this party was not Agatha's earliest memory. Riding over the snow on a sled was the first event in her life she remembered. Her father had equipped the sled with a box to contain her and her blankets, and her mother was pulling her downtown through a gray afternoon to visit her father at his law office and to shop for groceries. They passed the houses of Mary Lou, Frankie, and Jenny Marie, children Agatha was not yet aware of and whose birthday parties she was destined, alas, to attend.<br><br>"Come, I'll show you the invitations before lunch," she said, rousing herself from her childhood reverie. "If we don't hurry I may change my mind. I've never been a party sort of person."<br><br>Sitting at Agatha's desk in the sunroom, Janet wrote half a dozen times,<br><br>Please grant me the pleasure of your company on April 14th 4 o'clock until 7 o'clock p.m. in order that we may commemorate<br>our time together during the Flood of the Century.<br><br>~Agatha<br><p><br>She then addressed the envelopes and joined Agatha and Frederick in the kitchen for<br>lunch.</p></p><h2>Let&#39;s Toon Caricatures</h2><p>This is an instructional book on how to draw cartoon caricatures. With over 150 photos to practice from, it is the most extensive caricature book ever published. Multiple styles and medias are explored and there are step by step examples of how to draw caricature faces and cartoon bodies.</p><p>Over the past ten years, at my caricature stands at major theme parks and resorts, I have trained many of the artists who&#39;ve worked with me to draw caricatures. This book had its beginnings as a training manual for those artists. Then I began to think of all the people I&#39;ve drawn who asked how they themselves could learn to draw caricatures. That&#39;s when I realized that other people would be interested in this book as well, and began to rewrite it with that in mind. Whether you want to draw caricatures for fun or profit, or just want to learn about another area of cartooning, I think you&#39;ll find this book valuable. It&#39;s written so that beginners can understand it, but more advanced artists will benefit from its examples, concepts, and andecdotes as well.Over the past decade, Keelan Parham has drawn hundreds of thousands of caricatures for guests at major theme parks, resorts, and special events throughout the United States. In addition, he is serving his third term as the Vice President of the prestigious National Caricaturists Network(NCN), the international caricature artists' society. He has received the NCN's awards as the World's Fastest Caricaturist, and the Best Abstract/Design caricaturist. <p>Keelan's cartooning work has appeared in magazines, comic books, children's books, and various advertisements.</p></p><h2>Mary Had a Little Lamb</h2><p>A contemporary interpretation of the well-known nineteenth-century nursery rhyme about the school-going lamb, accompanied by color photographs, a sample exercise from McGuffey&#39;s reader, and a note on the history of the author and her famous rhyme</p><p>Tomie dePaola was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1934 to a family of Irish and Italian background. By the time he could hold a pencil, he knew what his life's work would be. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<p>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book, <i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.</p><p>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for <i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion. He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration.</p><p>Tomie dePaola has published almost 200 children's books in fifteen different countries.

But that is just what McMillan has so artfully done in this picture-book version of the poem. In an inventive blend of layout and design, he meshes the old and new together. The delicate endpapers and old-fashioned edgings to the photographs all serve as the proper background for the black, bespectacled young girl who is the model for Mary and the real coup of the book. This is a Mary who goes to school in an old-fashioned building, but with a male teacher. With her bright smile and yellow overalls, she is sure to connect with children meeting Mary for the first time. Mary has been portrayed elsewhere, such as in the picture-book version by Tomie dePaola (Holiday, 1984) as a lovely old-fashioned figure complete with pinafore and ringlets. McMillan has proven that this is no longer a universal portrayal. The fine design and excellent color scheme as well as the afterword, original poem, and explanations about the book make this a wonderfully crafted book that no library should miss. --Jane Marino, White Plains Pub .

Containing slightly more than 100 words and illustrated with charming pictures, this lively, funny tale is guaranteed to charm the socks off anyone who picks it up. Bull terrier Daisy thinks she's a baby--but the "real" baby in the house isn't amused. Daisy eats baby's breakfast, rides in the stroller, steals baby's toys and blanket, and loves to cuddle on Mom's lap ("The real baby hates that!!"). But the "real" baby needn't be concerned for long. In the last double-page spread, Daisy has backed out of the competition to become a mommy, and you can bet "the real baby likes that" a lot. Endpapers, front and back, show a harried human mom dealing with the cherubic child and the splendidly mischievous dog, while the artwork inside delivers grand close-ups of the rivaling duo. Daisy is pictured in especially nice detail; nursery colors befitting the story make the artwork light and airy, and the sweet, expressive faces of both Daisy and her youthful, perplexed opponent will leave readers totally delighted. Sure to be popular with young and old alike. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i>PreSchool-A patterned story with a surprise ending. Daisy the dog thinks she is a baby and likes to mimic her human counterpart, much to the child's dismay. Every activity, from eating breakfast in a high chair to cuddling in mother's lap is met with the retort: "But the real baby doesn't like that." The turnabout comes when the animal realizes that she "can't be a baby anymore...Because Daisy is a mommy!" And the happy child loves all the puppies. Most of the action is age-appropriate, as is the toddler's possessiveness. Cheerful colored-pencil drawings with plenty of white space make this an inviting story that will be fun to read aloud.<br><i>Caroline Parr, Central Rappahannock Regional Library, Fredericksburg, VA</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Travel Buddies (Disney/Pixar Cars) (Little Golden Book)</h2><p>Lightning McQueen and Mater travel to all four corners of the globe in this all-new Little Golden Book featuring all of your favorite characters from Disney/Pixar Cars 2.

The two were so impressed that they decided to photograph the homes--some 20 in all--in order to share this source of secret inspiration with others. The homes in <i>At Home with the Past: How the Love of Old Things Creates Beautiful Interiors</i> reach across a "wide variety of styles and budgets," making this perfect melding of the past and present affordable for all--from a cozy guest cottage stuffed to the rafters with yard-sale finds and a dilapidated Greek revival house full of the owner's idiosyncratic style, to a Moorish fantasy hideaway complete with flea-market Persian rugs and a "Nifty '50s" cabin in the Catskills. While advice from the individual homeowners is interesting and useful (try spicing up your space with fabric--a traditional pieced quilt can magically become a charming table-topper), it's the magnificent full-color photographs of the homes that will truly inspire those "seeking to re-create the beauty of the old in order to imbue their surroundings with a true sense of place.""It has been a fascinating experience to visit these extraordinary homes. Although each place reflects a completely different personal vision, they all express the same deeply held conviction that the old objects and ways from the past deserve to be honored and enjoyed."<br>-- From the Authors' Introduction</p><h2>Atlas of Military History (Military Missions)</h2><p>Atlas of Military History provides a fascinating, in-depth look at the world of warfare and reveals how the face of war has changed dramatically over the millennia with the emergence of new technology and tactical innovations that often proved decisive in conflicts.

"There's a problem we could use some help with. Your kind of help."Harry Keogh, Necroscope, might or might not know what was bothering the head of British E-Branch, and it might or might not have to do with him directly. "What is it, Darcy?" he said, speaking softly."It's murder," the other answered, and now his twitchiness came on strong, shaking his voice. "It's bloody awful murder, Harry! My God, I never saw anything like it!"Darcy Clarke had seen a lot in his time and Harry Keogh knew it, so that this was a statement he found hard to believe. Unless of course Clarke was talking about ... "<i>My</i> kind of help, you said?" Harry's attention was suddenly riveted to the phone. "Darcy, are you trying to tell me--that--?""What?" The other didn't understand him at first, but then he did. "No, no--Christ <i>no</i>--it's not the work of a vampire, Harry! But some kind of monster, certainly. Oh, human enough--but a monster, too."Harry relaxed a little, but a very little.He'd been expecting a call from E-Branch sooner or later. This could be it: some sort of clever trap. Except ... Darcy had always been his friend; Harry didn't think he would act on something--not even something like that--without checking it out every which way first. And even then Harry couldn't see Darcy coming after him with a crossbow andhardwood bolt, a machete, a can of petrol. No, he'd have to talk to him first, get Harry's side of it. But in the end ...... The head of the Branch knew almost as much about vampires now as Harry did. And he'd know, too, that there was no hope. They'd been friends, fighting on the same side, so Harry guessed it wouldn't be Darcy's finger on the trigger. But someone's, certainly."Harry?" Clarke was anxious. "Are you still there?""Where are you, Darcy?" Harry inquired."The Military Police duties room, in the castle," the other answered at once. "They found her body under the walls. Just a kid, Harry. Eighteen or nineteen. They don't even know who she is yet. That alone would be a big help. But to know who did it would be the biggest bonus of all."If there was one man Harry Keogh could trust, it had to be Darcy Clarke. "Give me fifteen minutes," he said, "and I'll be there."Clarke sighed. "Thanks, Harry. We'd appreciate it.""We?" Harry snapped. He couldn't keep the suspicion out of his voice."Eh?" Clarke sounded startled, taken aback. "Why, the police. And me."Murder. The police. Not a Branch job at all. So what was Clarke doing on it--<i>if</i> it was real? "How did you get roped in?"And suddenly, the other was ... caught on the hop? Cagey, anyway. "I ... I was up here on a 'duty run,' visiting an old Scottish auntie. Something I do once in a blue moon. She's been on her last legs for ten years now but won't lie down, keeps on tottering around! I was scheduled to go back down to HQ today, but then this came up. It's something the Branch has been trying to help the police with, a set of--God!--<i>gruesome</i> serial murders, Harry."An old Scottish auntie? It was the first time Harry had heard of Darcy's old auntie. On the other hand, this had to be a good opportunity to find out if they knew anything about ... about his problem. Harry knew he would have to be careful; he knew too much about E-Branch to just go walking right into something. Yes, and they knew too much about him. But maybe they didn't know everything. Not yet, anyway."Harry?" Clarke's voice came back again, tinny and a little distorted; probably the wires swaying in the winds that invariably blew around the castle's high walls. "Where will I see you?""On the esplanade, at the top of the Royal Mile," the Necroscope growled. "And Darcy ...""Yes?"" ... Nothing. We'll talk later." He replaced the telephone in its cradle,went back to his breakfast in the kitchen: an inch-thick steak, raw and bloody!&nbsp;<br>To look at, Darcy Clarke was possibly the world's most nondescript man. Nature had made up for this physical anonymity, however, by giving him an almost unique talent. Clarke was a deflector: he was the opposite of accident-prone. Only let him get close to danger and something, some parapsychological guardian angel, would intervene on his behalf. Which meant that if all of Clarke's similarly ESP-talented team of psychics were photographs, he'd be the only negative. He had no control over the thing; he was only ever aware of it on those occasions when he stared deliberately in the face of danger.The talents of the others--telepathy, scrying, foretelling, oneiromancy, lie-detecting--were more pliable, obedient, applicable; but not Clarke's. It just did its own thing, which was to look after him. It had no other use. But because it ensured his longevity, it made him the right man for the job. The anomaly was this: that he himself didn't quite believe in it until he felt it working. He still switched off the current before he'd even change a light bulb! But maybe that was just another example of the thing at work.To look at him, then, no one would suppose that Clarke could ever be the boss of anything, let alone head of the most secret branch of the British Secret Services. Middle-height, mousey-haired, with something of a slight stoop and a small paunch, and middle-aged to boot, he was middling in just about every way. He had sort of neutral-hazel eyes in a face not much given to laughter, and an intense mouth which you <i>might</i> remember if you remembered nothing else, but other than that there was a general facelessness about him which made him instantly forgettable. The rest of him, including the way he dressed, was ... medium.These were Harry Keogh's perfectly mundane thoughts in the few seconds which ticked by after he stepped out of the metaphysical M�bius Continuum onto the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle, and saw Darcy Clarke standing there with his back to him, hands thrust deep in the pockets of his overcoat, reading the legend on a brass plaque above a seventeenth-century drinking trough.The iron fountain, picturing two heads, one ugly and the other beatific, stood:... Near the site on which many witches were burned at the stake. The wicked head and serene head signify that some used exceptional knowledge for evilpurposes, while others were misunderstood and wished their kind nothing but good.The bright May day would be warm but for the gusting wind; the esplanade was almost empty; two dozen or so tourists stood in small groups at the higher end of the broad, walled, tarmac plateau, looking down across the walls at the city, or taking photographs of the great grey fortress--the Castle on the Rock--behind its fa�ade of battlements and courtyards. Harry had arrived in the moment after Clarke, vainly scanning the esplanade for some sign of him, had turned to the plaque.A moment ago Clarke had been alone with his thoughts and no living person within fifty feet of him. But now a soft voice behind him said:"Fire is an indiscriminate destroyer. Good or evil, everything burns when it's hot enough."Clarke's heart jumped into his throat. He gave a massive start and whirled about, the color rushing from his face and leaving him pale in a moment. "Ha-Ha-Harry!" he gasped. "God, I didn't see you! Where did you spring--?" But here he paused, for of course he <i>knew</i> where Harry had sprung from ... because the Necroscope had taken him there once, into that everywhere and -when place, that within and without, which was the M�bius Continuum.Shaken, heart hammering, Clarke clutched at the wall for support. But it wasn't terror, just shock; his talent read no sinister purpose into Keogh's presence.Harry smiled at him and nodded, touched his arm briefly, then looked at the plaque again. And his smile at once turned sour. "Mainly, they were exorcising their own fears," he said. "For of course most if not all of these women were innocent. Indeed, we should all be so innocent.""Eh?" Clarke hadn't quite recovered his balance yet, wasn't focusing on Keogh's meaning. "Innocent?" He too looked at the plaque."Completely." Harry nodded again. "Oh, they may have been talented in their way, but they were hardly evil! Witchcraft? Why, today you'd probably try to recruit them into E-Branch!"Suddenly, truth flooded in on Clarke and he knew he wasn't dreaming; no need to pinch himself and start awake; it was just this effect which Harry always had on him. Three weeks ago in the Greek islands (was that all it had been, three weeks?) it had been the same. Except at that time Harry had been near-impotent: he didn't have his deadspeak. Then he'd got it back, and set out on his double mission: to destroy the vampire Janos Ferenczy and regain his mastery of--Clarke snatched a breath. "You got it back!" He grabbed Harry's arm. "The M�bius Continuum!""You didn't get in touch with me," Harry accused, however quietly, "or you'd have known.""I got your letter," Clarke quickly defended himself, "and I tried a dozen times to get you on the phone. But if you were home you weren't answering. Our locators couldn't find you ..." He threw up his hands. "Give me a chance, Harry! I've only been back from the Med a few days, and a pile of stuff to catch up with back here, too! But we'd finished the job in the islands, and we supposed you'd done the same at your end. Our espers were on it, of course; reports were coming in; Janos's place above Halmagiu, blown off the mountain like that. It could only be you. We knew you'd somehow won. But the M�bius Continuum, too? Why, that's ... wonderful! I'm delighted for you!"Harry wondered: <i>Oh, really?</i> But out loud he only said: "Thanks.""How in hell did you <i>do</i> that?" Clarke was still excited. If it was all a sham he was good at it. "I mean, wreck the castle that way? If we've got it right it was devastating! Is that how Janos died, in the explosion?""Slow down," Harry told him, taking his arm. "We can talk while you take me to see this girl."The other's excitement quickly ebbed. "Yes"--he nodded, his tone subdued now--"and that's something else, too. You won't like it, Harry.""So what's new?" The Necroscope seemed as calm (resigned, soulful, sardonic?) as ever. And though he tried not to show it, Clarke suspected he was wary, too. "Did you ever show me anything I did like?"But Clarke had an answer to that one. "If everything was the way we'd like it, Harry," he said, "then we'd all be out of work. Me, I'd gladly retire tomorrow. I keep threatening to. But when I see something like ... like I'm going to show you, then I know that someone has to do it."As they started up the esplanade, Harry said: "Now, <i>this</i> is a castle!" His voice was more animated now. "But as for the Castle Ferenczy: that was a heap long before I got started on it. You asked how I did it?" He sighed, then continued:"A long time ago, toward the end of the Bodescu affair, I learned about an ammo and explosives dump in Kolomyya and used stuff from there to blow up the Chateau Bronnitsy. Well, since the easy way is often the best way, I did it again. I made two or three trips, M�bius trips, and put enough plastic explosive into the foundations of Janos's place to blow it to hell! I'm not even going to guess what was in the guts of that place, but I'm sure there was--<i>stuff</i>--there which even I didn't see and still don't want to. Youknow, Darcy, even a finger-end of Semtex will blow bricks right out of a wall? So you can imagine what a couple of hundredweights will do. If there was anything there that we might call 'alive'"--he shrugged and shook his head--"it wasn't when I'd finished."While Harry talked, the head of E-Branch studied him. But not so intently that he would notice. He seemed exactly the same man Clarke had come to Edinburgh to see just a month ago, a visit which had ended for Clarke in Rhodes and the islands of the Dodecanese, and for Harry in the mountains of Transylvania. He <i>seemed</i> the same, but was he? For the fact was, Darcy Clarke knew someone who said he wasn't.Harry Keogh was a composite. He was two men: the mind of one and the body of another. The mind was Keogh and the body was ... it had once been Alec Kyle. And Clarke had known Kyle, too, in his time. The strangest thing was this: that as time progressed, so the Kyle face and form got to look more like the old Harry, whose body was dead. But that was something which always made Clarke's brain spin. He skipped it, put the metaphysical right out of his mind and studied the purely physical.The Necroscope was perhaps forty-three or -four but looked five years younger. But of course that was only the body; the mind was five years younger again. Even thinking about someone like Harry Keogh was a weird business. And again Clarke forced himself to concentrate on the physical.Harry's eyes were honey-brown, occasionally defensive and frequently puppy-soulful--or would be if one could see under those wedge-sided sunglasses he was wearing in the shade of his broad-brimmed 1930s hat. If there was one thing in all the world Clarke hated to see, it had to be Harry wearing those dark-lensed glasses and that hat. Anyone else, no problem. But not Harry, and not now. Especially the sunglasses. They were something Clarke had told himself to look out for; for while it was a common enough thing to wear such in the Greek islands in late April or early May, it was quite another to see them in Edinburgh that time of year. Unless someone had weak eyes. Or different eyes ...Grey streaks, so evenly spaced as to seem deliberately designed or affected, were plentiful in Harry's russet-brown, naturally wavy hair. In a few years the grey could easily take over; even now it loaned him a certain erudition, gave him the look of a scholar. A scholar, yes, but in what fabulous subjects? But in fact Keogh hadn't been like that at all. Hadn't used to be. What, Harry, a black magician? A warlock? Lord, no!... Just a Necroscope: a man who talked to dead people.Keogh's body had been well fleshed, maybe even a little overweightonce. With his height, however, that ought not to have mattered a great deal. But it had mattered to Harry. After that business at the Chateau Bronnitsy--his metempsychosis--he'd trained his new body down, brought it to a peak of perfection. Or at least done what he could with it, considering its age. That's why it looked only thirty-seven or -eight years old.And inside Harry's body and behind his face an innocent. Or someone who had used to be innocent. He hadn't asked to be the way he was, hadn't wanted to become E-Branch's most powerful weapon and do the things he'd done. But he'd been what he was and the rest had come as a matter of course. And now? Was he still an innocent? Did he still have the soul of a child? Did he have any soul at all? Or did something else have him?Now the pair had passed under the archway of the military guardroom, where several police officers had been interviewing a group of uniformed soldiers, into the cobbled gantlet which was the approach alley to the castle proper. All of the officers in the guardroom seemed aware that Clarke was "something big"; they weren't challenged; suddenly, the bulk of the castle loomed before...</p><h2>The Blue Cotton Gown: A Midwife&#39;s Memoir</h2><p>Heather is pale and thin, seventeen and pregnant with twins when Patricia Harman begins to care for her. Over the course of the next five seasons Patsy will see Heather through the loss of both babies and their father. She will also care for her longtime patient Nila, pregnant for the eighth time and trying to make a new life without her abusive husband. And Patsy will try to find some comfort to offer Holly, whose teenage daughter struggles with bulimia. She will help Rebba learn to find pleasure in her body and help Kaz transition into a new body. She will do noisy battle with the IRS in the very few moments she has to spare, and wage her own private battle with uterine cancer.<br><br>Patricia Harman, a nurse-midwife, manages a women's health clinic with her husband, Tom, an ob-gyn, in West Virginia-a practice where patients open their hearts, where they find care and sometimes refuge. Patsy's memoir juxtaposes the tales of these women with her own story of keeping a small medical practice solvent and coping with personal challenges. Her patients range from Appalachian mothers who haven't had the opportunity to attend secondary school to Ph.D.'s on cell phones. They come to Patsy's small, windowless exam room and sit covered only by blue cotton gowns, and their infinitely varied stories are in equal parts heartbreaking and uplifting. The nurse-midwife tells of their lives over the course of a year and a quarter, a time when her outwardly successful practice is in deep financial trouble, when she is coping with malpractice threats, confronting her own serious medical problems, and fearing that her thirty-year marriage may be on the verge of collapse. In the words of Jacqueline Mitchard, this memoir, "utterly true and lyrical as any novel . . . should be a little classic."</p><p>Patricia Harman, CNM, has published in The Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health and The Journal of Sigma Theta Tau for Nursing Scholarship as well as alternative publications. She is a regular presenter at national midwifery conferences. Harman got her start as a lay-midwife on the rural communes where she lived in the '60s and '70s, going on to become a nurse-midwife on the faculty of Ohio State University, Case Western Reserve University, and West Virginia University. She lives and works near Morgantown, West Virginia, and has three sons.The many moving stories of the women that Patricia Harman cares for as a nurse-midwife add up to a remarkable account of a life spent listening, helping, and taking care. Inviting us into her clinic in rural West Virginia, she shows us the joys and sorrows of listening to women's stories and attending to their bodies, and she leads us through the complicated life of a healer who is profoundly shaped by her patients and their journeys. &#x2014;Perri Klass, author of <i>The Mercy Rule</i> and <i>Treatment Kind and Fair</i><br><br>"Nobody writes with more candor and compassion about women's woes and women's triumphs than nurse-midwife Patricia Harman.

What I didn't realize was that it would cause me, a sensible person, to get into the bath with one sock still on and rise from it when the candle was gone and the water cold. Utterly true and lyrical as any novel, Harman's book should be a little classic."&#x2014;Jacquelyn Mitchard, author of <i>The Deep End of the Ocean</i> and <i>Cage of Stars</i><br><br>"Patsy has the ability to put a knife in your gut, to make you long for things you have experienced and things you have not." &#x2014;Penny Armstrong, co-author of <i>A Midwife's Story</i><br><br>"In <i>The Blue Cotton Gown</i>, Patsy Harman, midwife and women's health care specialist, reveals herself as a real person-a wife and mother who has trouble sleeping, who has financial worries, who has suffered betrayal and loss, and who always runs late-someone with whom we can identify. But her faults and troubles seem inconsequential when we witness her compassion, wisdom, and good judgment in this gripping and heartwarming 'love song to women.' Through her clients' compelling stories of misfortune, survival, and triumph, Patsy Harman has composed an unromantic, down-to-earth idealization of women as told through their stories of loss and triumph." &#x2014;Penny Simkin, childbirth educator, doula, and author of <i>The Birth Partner: Everything You Need to Know to Help a Woman Through Labor</i> <br><br>"Patricia Harman, Certified Nurse-Midwife, writes a book that tells the story of the reality of life as a midwife in private practice with her obstetrician/gynecologist husband.

Iowa &amp; Its Cover-Up</h2><p>Probes the explosion of the center gun on the USS Iowa, a disaster that instantly killed several sailors on board, and the fouled investigation that followed, resulting in a large-scale cover-up</p><p>On April 19, 1989, Turret Two aboard the recommissioned battleship USS <i>Iowa</i> exploded, killing 47 men. In <i>A Glimpse of Hell</i>, former naval officer, newspaper reporter, and <i>60 Minutes</i> producer Charles Thompson has written an authoritative expos� of the United States Navy high command's consistent efforts to manipulate the evidence of that disaster and slander deceased seaman Clayton Hartwig. The <i>Iowa</i> investigation is contextualized by Thompson's startling insights into the moral universe of the navy's masters, a cabal so protective of their own jobs that they prepared press releases indicating that an out-of-control Tomahawk missile launched from the <i>Iowa</i> was actually a part of a federal and military crackdown on an illicit marijuana field in Alabama. Unlike the Tomahawk debacle, the falsehoods embroidered into the investigation of the Turret Two disaster did become public, as naval officials accepted a noticeably botched report from investigators who "lost" two 2,700-pound projectiles and consistently claimed, with no foundation, that Hartwig, killed in the explosion, was a murderous and suicidal psychopath who blew up the turret in revenge for a thwarted homosexual affair. Two years later, they were forced to admit that they had no clear and convincing evidence linking Hartwig to the explosion and apologized to his surviving family members. (The family later initiated a $12 million defamation lawsuit against the U.S. Navy.)<p> As active duty officers rebuffed his own investigation, Thompson found that many personnel, including captains and admirals, were willing to talk when their careers were no longer on the line. <i>A Glimpse of Hell</i> assiduously follows the <i>Iowa</i> story with a dedication that honors the dead and their families, as one journalist does more to expose the careerism and sexual preoccupations of ranking naval officers--and their consequences--than any government investigative agency. <i>--James Highfill</i></p>A thoroughly researched, exhaustively detailed look at the gun-turret explosion aboard the recommissioned battleship USS Iowa by a former naval officer, reporter, and producer of 60 Minutes (for which he produced two segments on this incident). Thompson skillfully reconstructs the conditions and events leading up to the explosion in gun-turret number two, which killed 47 men; he also vividly portrays the various people who played key roles in the explosion and the subsequent investigation. While the technical particulars of the incident and the ships history would take an advanced science degree to master, Thompson manages to convey the salient facts in a clear and accessible light. But its in his account of the navys reaction to the explosion that he particularly excelshe shows an entire bureaucracy in action and depicts such personages as the captain of the Iowa, Fred Moosally, making greater attempts to limit damage to his career than to discover the cause of the accident and prevent possible future loss of life. Thompson takes the navy to task for trying to depict one dead sailor, Clayton Hartwig, as a homosexual, and then pinning a charge of sabotage against him for intentionally causing the explosion to settle a lovers quarrel. Hartwigs parents are central figures in the book, showing the callousness of the navy in its efforts to shift the blame to their son. While Thompson doesnt provide final conclusions for what caused the accidentthe navy couldnt determine a causehe conjectures that improper handling of WWII-era powder was a likely factor. A compelling look at an explosion at sea and the navys botched handling of its investigation by a top-flight journalist. (photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A true story from the author of <i>The Fairy Ring</i>.</b><br><br>One day in 1798, woodsmen in southern France returned from the forest having captured a naked boy. He had been running wild, digging for food, and was covered with scars. In the village square, people gathered around, gaping and jabbering in words the boy didn&#x2019;t understand. And so began the curious public life of the boy known as the Savage of Aveyron, whose journey took him all the way to Paris. Though the wild boy&#x2019;s world was forever changed, some things stayed the same: sometimes, when the mountain winds blew, &#x201c;he looked up at the sky, made sounds deep in his throat, and gave great bursts of laughter.&#x201d; In a moving work of narrative nonfiction that reads like a novel, Mary Losure invests another compelling story from history with vivid and arresting new life.<br>Back matter includes an author&#x2019;s note, source notes, and a bibliography.</p><p><b>Mary Losure</b>, author of <i>The Fairy Ring</i>, has worked as a reporter for Minnesota Public Radio and a contributor to National Public Radio.

Many people complain of burnout, and economic instability and the threat of ecological catastrophe fill us with dread. We look to the past, imagining life to have once been simpler and slower, but extreme mental and physical stress is not a modern syndrome. Beginning in classical antiquity, this book demonstrates how exhaustion has always been with us and helps us evaluate more critically the narratives we tell ourselves about the phenomenon.<br><br>Medical, cultural, literary, and biographical sources have cast exhaustion as a biochemical imbalance, a somatic ailment, a viral disease, and a spiritual failing. It has been linked to loss, the alignment of the planets, a perverse desire for death, and social and economic disruption. Pathologized, demonized, sexualized, and even weaponized, exhaustion unites the mind with the body and society in such a way that we attach larger questions of agency, willpower, and well-being to its symptoms. Mapping these political, ideological, and creative currents across centuries of human development, <i>Exhaustion</i> finds in our struggle to overcome weariness a more significant effort to master ourselves.</p><p>Are we the most tired, depressed, and depleted society in centuries&#x2015;or just obsessing over a fundamental condition of life?Anna Katharina Schaffner is reader in comparative literature and medical humanities at the University of Kent.

Her book <i>Silk and Steel</i> was nominated for a RITA Award. She is a graduate of the University of California, where she majored in Anthropology and History, a background that helped to develop her interest in the past. "I love anything old," she says. "I especially love to visit the settings for my books. My husband and I often stay in out-of-the-way inns and houses built in times past. It's fun and it gives a wonderful sense of a bygone era." Before becoming a writer, Martin was a real estate broker. She lives with her husband, author Larry Jay Martin, in Missoula, Montana.Dominic Edgemont's reputation in late Georgian British society is rather tarnished: aside from rumors of womanizing, he's said to be part gypsy--a rumor that Catherine Barrington, Countess of Arondale, discovers to be true after she is kidnapped by scheming relatives, passed from hand to hand and finally bought by Dominic who is visiting the gypsy band where he was raised. A clash of wills follows as Dominic tries to seduce Catherine out of the virginity she has so far managed to preserve; as fate would have it, the two, not surprisingly, fall in love and he succeeds. Martin's tale is a good one with some reservations, one being an unnecessary scene in which Catherine provokes Dominic into beating her to the delight of the gypsy camp. Early on, Martin is careless with certain genre conventions almost to the point of comedy: Edgemont's title (Lord Nightwyck, heir to the Marquess of Gravenwold) overhints at the diabolical and Martin's description of Catherine as an atypical beauty--with "eyes . . . a little too large and a little too green, and her lips were a little too full"--makes one wonder at the era's ideal. Although well-intentioned, Martin ( Captain's Bride ) also sometimes buys into stereotypes about gypsies. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Top 100 Prayers of the Bible (Top 100 Series)</h2><p>If it&#x2019;s true that we learn best by example, here are 100 examples of some of the most powerful prayers in the Bible.

There was the smell of wet khaskhas<br> mats hanging across the doors and windows to keep out the heat of<br> early summer, sweet and musty; there was the smell of the<br> jasmine which grew over the bungalow; there was the bass<br> accompaniment inseparable from India of drains and of<br> dung. But tonight there was something else.<br><br> Sharp and acrid, it was the smell of smoke. Midge sat up and<br> looked about her. Running across the ceiling of her room there<br> was a flickering reflection of flames. She struggled out of her<br> mosquito net and, barefoot, stood down on the floor. She called<br> for her father and then remembered he was away in Calcutta.<br> She called for her mother but it was Ayah who answered her call.<br><br> &#x2018;Come with Ayah, now, Missy Baba,&#x2019; she said urgently.&nbsp;&#x2018;Come swiftly. <br>Be silent!&#x2019;<br><br> Ayah gathered her up. &#x2018;Put your arms round me and hold<br> tight. Very tight. Put your feet on mine and we&#x2019;ll walk together<br> as we used to when you were a baby and then the bad, bad<br> men won&#x2019;t see my Missy Baba. If I hide you under my sari<br> they&#x2019;ll just think that Ayah has another baby on the way.&#x2019;<br><br> She swept silky folds over Midge&#x2019;s head and they set off to<br> waddle together towards safety. They had often done this<br> before; it had been a game of her infancy. It was called &#x2018;elephant<br> walk backwards&#x2019; and now this clumsy game was to save<br> her life. Midge caught brief glimpses of Ayah&#x2019;s sandalled feet<br> and was aware of others milling protectively about them and<br> then they were in the open air. They were free of the bungalow.<br> Men&#x2019;s voices &#x2013; Indian voices &#x2013; shouted harshly, shots rang<br> out, a woman&#x2019;s scream was abruptly cut short and then the<br> roar of the fire as it took hold of the thatch grew deafening.<br><br> But then, gravel was crunching under Ayah&#x2019;s feet and she<br> stopped. &#x2018;Sit here,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Sit here and keep quiet. Don&#x2019;t<br> move. Be hidden.&#x2019; And she tucked Midge away amongst the<br> rank of tall earthenware pots overflowing with bougainvillea<br> and zinnia.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> In the mess, half a mile away, Jonno crossed and uncrossed his<br> legs under the table and with a slightly unsteady hand poured<br> himself a glass of port and passed the decanter. He was thinking<br> &#x2013; he was often thinking &#x2013; of Dolly Prentice, or, more formally,<br> Mrs Major Prentice. He was sure he hadn&#x2019;t imagined<br> that, as he had helped her into her wrap after the gymkhana<br> dance, she had leant back against him, not obviously but perceptibly.<br> Yes, surely perceptibly. And his hands had rested on<br> her shoulders, slightly moist because it had been a hot night,<br> and there had been a warm female scent. What was it she had<br> said when, greatly daring, he had admired? &#x2018;Chypre.&#x2019; Yes, that<br> was it &#x2013; &#x2018;Chypre.&#x2019;<br><br> And that wasn&#x2019;t all. They had danced close. Not difficult<br> when doing a two-step and she had said, almost out of the<br> blue, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re getting to be quite a big boy now.&#x2019; It might have<br> meant anything; it might have meant nothing.<br> But he didn&#x2019;t think so. In memory he held that slender figure in its red chiffon<br> dress as close as he dared.<br><br> The young subaltern on Jonno&#x2019;s left was also thinking of<br> Dolly Prentice. He knew she&#x2019;d only been joking but she had<br> said, &#x2018;Just bring your problems to me, young man, and I&#x2019;ll see<br> what I can do.&#x2019; Had she meant it? He thought probably not.<br> But it had been accompanied by a steady and speaking glance<br> and, after his third glass of port, he decided, nevertheless, to<br> take her at her word.<br><br> That bloody pony! Fifty pounds! He hadn&#x2019;t got fifty pounds!<br> Why had he fallen for it? He knew only too well why. He&#x2019;d<br> been goaded into it by Prentice. &#x2018;Take it or leave it. Pony&#x2019;s<br> yours for fifty pounds but be warned &#x2013; he takes a bit of riding!&#x2019;<br> And the clear implication &#x2013; &#x2018;Too much of a handful for you!&#x2019;<br> He thought if he threw himself on Dolly&#x2019;s mercy, she might<br> intercede for him &#x2013; get him off his bargain. Perhaps she could<br> persuade her husband not to take advantage of a young and<br> inexperienced officer? He didn&#x2019;t like appearing in the role of<br> innocent naughty boy but still less did he like having to borrow<br> yet again.<br><br> Then, by God! The pony! In his secret heart he was aware<br> that he couldn&#x2019;t manage it. The pony was vicious. He had<br> made a mess of Prentice&#x2019;s syce. Put him on his back for a week,<br> they said. &#x2018;Oh, what the hell!&#x2019; he thought. &#x2018;Damnation to you,<br> Major Prentice!&#x2019; And he drained his glass.<br><br> The regimental doctor sitting opposite watched him guardedly.<br> He always felt out of place in the elegant company of<br> Bateman&#x2019;s Horse. He tried not to, but could not help contrasting<br> the splendour of their grey and silver mess dress with his<br> own Indian Medical Service dark blue. He was not, in fact,<br> thinking about Dolly Prentice. He was thinking about Prentice.<br> He remembered (would he ever forget?) the public<br> shame that had followed his first greeting at the hands of<br> Major Prentice.<br><br> &#x2018;Tell me, doctor,&#x2019; he had said, &#x2018;&#x2013; we are all so eager to know<br> &#x2013; from what barrow in Petticoat Lane did you buy those boots?&#x2019;<br><br> It was true that his boots did not come from a fashionable<br> boot-maker. They had come from a saddler in Maidstone and<br> they had looked good enough when he had first tried them<br> on. He was painfully aware that, by comparison with the<br> officers of Bateman&#x2019;s Horse, the &#x2018;Bengal Greys&#x2019;, he lacked the<br> skintight precision supplied by Lobb of St James&#x2019;s, the skintight<br> precision which forbade anything more substantial<br> inside than a cut-down ladies&#x2019; silk stocking.<br><br> His thoughts turned to Dolly. Dolly with her large eyes<br> and her ready sympathy. How could she bear life with that<br> devil? How could she put up with him close to her? And a<br> vision of Dolly in the arms of Giles Prentice rose, not for the<br> first time, to trouble him. He imagined the heat of an Indian<br> night. He imagined the close confines of a mosquito net. He<br> tried but did not succeed in keeping at bay the vision of<br> Prentice&#x2019;s slim brown hands exploring the surface anatomy<br> which his fervid imagination and medical experience conjured<br> up. Too easily.<br><br> The senior officer present, Major Harry, looked up and<br> down the table. Over-bright eyes, mottled faces, desultory<br> and slurred speech &#x2013; there was no doubt about it, when Prentice<br> was away conversation ebbed and the drink flowed to fill the<br> gaps. And Prentice was away. He had gone to Calcutta for an<br> interview for promotion to the senior branch. &#x2018;But why Giles?<br> Why not me?&#x2019; There could only be one of them this time and<br> that one was Prentice. This had been the moment when he<br> might have broken through and God knew when there might<br> be another one.<br><br> His career really needed the step. He needed the money.<br> Very soon there would be children to be sent home to school<br> in England. Already his wife was complaining<br> and he was sick of the endless litany &#x2013; &#x2018;Nothing to wear . . . only one carriage<br> horse . . . when can we buy our own furniture?&#x2019; He had desperately<br> needed this step and now Prentice had it. Pretentious<br> Prentice!<br><br> Dickie Templar likewise surveyed the company. On attachment<br> and waiting to join a Gurkha regiment on the north-west<br> frontier, he was glad that he was not to be gazetted into<br> Bateman&#x2019;s Horse. He felt that though they had a glowing past<br> (they had been golden heroes of the Mutiny) they had for too<br> long rested on their laurels and their promotion prospects<br> were not good. And the officers &#x2013; they bored him. Further<br> than that, they even repelled him. Sick of their company, he<br> rose from the table and made his way to the ghulskhana<br> where, with difficulty, unbuttoning the flap of his tight mess<br> trousers, he stood for a moment aiming largely by memory<br> in the darkness.<br><br> It was a fetid little enclosure and with his spare hand he<br> pushed open the window through which instantly there<br> came a murmur of unfamiliar sound. An unfamiliar<br> sound in a crescendo and &#x2013; there &#x2013; what was that? A shot. And<br> another shot. Buttoning himself up, he stood on tiptoe and<br> gazed out of the window. There was a yellow leaping flame<br> beginning to spring from one of the bungalows, about half a<br> mile away, he judged. A fire? Yes, there was a fire and now<br> there was a smell of smoke. A fire in the lines? Probably nothing.<br> No one else seemed aware of it as he hurried back to the<br> dining-room.<br><br> &#x2018;There&#x2019;s a fire!&#x2019; he said. And then again, &#x2018;There&#x2019;s a fire in<br> the lines!&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br><br> In line abreast, the five Greys officers cantered on down<br> towards the disturbance. They clattered into the compound<br> and surveyed with dismay the ruin of Prentice&#x2019;s house. And<br> here they were challenged by a figure in a scarlet mess<br> jacket, his white shirt front blackened. The Braganza Lamb<br> in silver thread on his lapel identified the Queen&#x2019;s duty<br> officer. Four British soldiers, presumably<br> the Queen&#x2019;s fire picket, were hauling on the handle of the fire engine and<br> two more were directing a jet of water into the ruin. Others,<br> faces bound in cloth, made useless attempts to approach.<br> Riflemen stood by.<br><br> &#x2018;What the hell&#x2019;s been going on here?&#x2019; said Major Harry.<br><br> &#x2018;Disaster! Total disaster!&#x2019; came the reply. &#x2018;We did our best<br> but we were too late. Bloody fire engine! About as much good<br> as a water pistol! We organised a bucket chain but we were too<br> few and too late.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Too late to save the bungalow?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;To hell with the bungalow! Too late to save Dolly and<br> Midge Prentice.&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;But they&#x2019;re in Calcutta with Giles! He always takes them<br> with him!&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Not this time, he didn&#x2019;t! It&#x2019;s Midge&#x2019;s birthday tomorrow<br> &#x2013; Dolly stayed at home with her for her party. Good God! My<br> girls were going!&#x2019; He wiped a blackened and bleeding hand<br> across his face. &#x2018;My girls were to be there,&#x2019; he said again. &#x2018;No,<br> there&#x2019;s no sign of Midge or her mother . . . must be still in<br> there . . . what&#x2019;s left of the poor devils . . . The minute this lot<br> cools down enough to get men in we&#x2019;ll look for the bodies.<br> Jesus! And Prentice away! I say &#x2013; a disaster!&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;But who the hell . . .?&#x2019;<br><br> &#x2018;Dacoits . . . we think it was dacoits. Doped up, no doubt &#x2013;<br> drugged-up courage. In a mood to stop at nothing. It happens.<br> Prentice had been routing them out of village after<br> village and they came for him. Didn&#x2019;t know he was away, I suppose<br> . . . Or perhaps they knew only too well! They&#x2019;ve chased<br> all the servants off or they&#x2019;ve fled. No sign of them anyway.<br> Come crawling back in the morning I dare say and then we&#x2019;ll<br> find out more.&#x2019;<br><br> Dickie Templar had heard enough. He turned aside and<br> blundered into the darkness to hide his distress. He stopped<br> dead. He had heard a faint cry.<br><br> From a stack of tall flowerpots there emerged a ghostlike<br> figure: Midge Prentice, white face a mask of terror, her<br> bunched nightie gripped convulsively in a small hot hand.<br> Dickie fell on his knees and gathered her in his arms, sobbing,<br> kissing her face and holding her to him, murmuring childish<br> endearments. &#x2018;You got out!&#x2019; he said at last. &#x2018;You got out!&#x2019; And<br> then, &#x2018;Where&#x2019;s Mummy?&#x2019;<br><br> For reply, the child pointed dumbly to the smouldering<br> ruin of the house.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> Chapter Two<br> Calcutta 1922<br><br> Commander Joseph Sandilands of the Metropolitan Police<br> was delighted to be going home. Delighted that his six<br> months&#x2019; secondment from the Met to the Bengal Police<br> should, at last, be at an end.<br><br> He&#x2019;d had enough India. He&#x2019;d had enough heat. He&#x2019;d had<br> enough smells.<br><br> Though no stranger to the midden that was the East End<br> of London he&#x2019;d not, by a long way, been able to accept the<br> poverty that surrounded him. And he still resented the social<br> formalities of Calcutta. As a London policeman, his social<br> status had been, at the least, equivocal in the precedent-conscious<br> atmosphere of the capital of Bengal. He had<br> counted the days until he could pack, say his farewells and<br> go, but even that pleasure was denied him; inevitably, the<br> bearer who had been assigned to him had done his packing<br> for him. But, by whatever means, it was at last done and<br> tomorrow he&#x2019;d be gone.<br><br> For the last time &#x2013; he sincerely hoped it was the last time &#x2013;<br> he made his way into the office that had been allocated to<br> him. For the last time he cursed the electric fan that didn&#x2019;t<br> work. For the last time he was embarrassed<br> by the patient presence of the punkha-wallah manipulating the sweeping fan that<br> disturbed but did not disperse the heavy air. There was,<br> however, a neat envelope lying on his desk. Stamped across<br> the flap were the words: &#x2018;The Office of the Governor&#x2019;.<br><br> With anxious hand he tore open the envelope and read:<br><br> <i>Dear Sandilands,</i><br> <i>I hope you can make it convenient to call in and see</i><br> <i>me this morning. Something has cropped up which we</i><br> <i>should discuss. I have sent a rickshaw.</i><br> <i>Yours sincerely,</i><br><br> And an indecipherable signature followed with the words<br> &#x2018;Sir George Jardine, Acting Governor of Bengal&#x2019;.<br><br> Joe didn&#x2019;t like the sound of this. Could he pretend he&#x2019;d<br> never received it and just leave? No, they&#x2019;d catch him in the<br> act and what could be more embarrassing than being brought<br> back from the docks under police escort? Better not chance<br> it! He looked angrily out of the window and there were,<br> indeed, two liveried rickshaw men waiting to deliver him to<br> the Governor. He&#x2019;d met George Jardine on one or two formal<br> occasions during his secondment and formed a good impression<br> of the distinguished old pro-consul who had come out of<br> retirement to bridge the gap between two incumbents.<br><br> The appointment seemed to be a formal one and he<br> paused in the vestibule to check his appearance. &#x2018;God! You<br> look tired, Sandilands,&#x2019; he muttered at his reflection.<br> He still half expected to see the eager youth who had set off for the<br> war with the Scots Fusiliers but, though the hair was still black<br> and plentiful, after four years in France and four years with<br> the police his expression was watchful now and cynical. An old<br> wound on his forehead &#x2013; badly stitched &#x2013; had pulled up the<br> corner of one eyebrow so that, even in repose, his face looked<br> perpetually enquiring. Six months of Indian sun appeared to<br> have bleached his grey eyes as it had darkened his skin. But at<br> least in India everything he possessed was polished without<br> any word from him. He adjusted his black Sam Browne belt<br> shining like glass, his silver rank badges and his medal ribbons,<br> the blue of the police medal almost edged out by the red<br> and blue DSO and his three war medals.

Her book ignites with a proclamation, "In the beginning was the word, fanning out into syllables, like a deck of cards on a table in Vegas, lovely leafy parts fluttering into atoms and cells, genus and phylum, nouns and verbs;" an easy metaphor for her intoxicating linguistic machinations.</p> <p>Hamby's roaming, inquisitive mind reels in the reader, "I'm persuaded the day will come when I'll lie static as a falcon in a hunter's sack, fragments of iron studding my reckless breast." Not limited to the self-referential, Hamby playfully references historic and literary personae, taking stabs at Shakespeare, Jane Austen, the Bible and Casanova. "Who wouldn't," she challenges us, "give anything for the voice of an angel and wings to fly above the rough dirt of birth?"</p></p><p><p><b>Barbara Hamby </b>has been published in many literary magazines and is the editor of <i>Apalachee Quarterly</i> and director of Apalachee Press. Her first published collection,<i> Delirium</i>, won the 1994 Vassar Miller Prize, the 1996 Kate Tufts Discovery Award and the Poetry Society of America's Norma Farber First Book Award.</p>paper 0-8147-3598-3 The second collection by the editor of the Apalachee Review is a prizewinner like the first: Delirium (1994) won the Vassar Miller award, and now this ample new volume has been selected for NYUs annual prize. Everything about it is excessive: the lines run on, the poems race all over the place, the sensibility embraces all things, and there are just too many poems. Actually, theres lots of poetry here, but few distinctly individual poems; Hamby seldom varies her expressive style, which, at its best, results in energetic, jazzy rhythms, a bebop / babble, that, however, the writer fails to sustain throughout this exhausting book. The greater the risks she takes, the greater her flops: With Sonya, a poem about movie-going, digresses on Roman Polanski (he shouldnt fuck thirteen-year-old girls), and poems addressing world-historical events unintentionally recall Mel Brooks, especially the tasteless Springtime for Hitler bit in Reichsfhrer Blues, a way-too casual and self-assured poem about the Holocaust and human disaster: Heave ho, heave ho, its off to bake you go . . . . Hamby piles on nouns and adjectives with no concern for synonymy: her logorrheic effusions and her rhumba / with the infinite find her ranting and raving, often about her own neuroses. The dullest poems simply celebrate the poets husband: him sleeping beside her (Beriberi); her hugging Mr.Pillow when hes away; him among beautiful students (The Dream of the Red Drink); him as samurai and warlord (Irony Waltz), and so on. A mid-section of poems is arranged somewhat pointlessly as an abcedarium, and 13 Italian odes only show off the writers limited foreign vocabulary. Provocative, and at times plain silly, Hambys verse bombards us with its expansiveness. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is also a captivating brief history of astronomy, navigation and clockmaking.<br><br>During the great ages of exploration, "the longitude problem" was the gravest of all scientific challenges. Lacking the ability to determine their longitude, sailors were literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Ships ran aground on rocky shores; those traveling well-known routes were easy prey to pirates.<br><br>In 1714, England's Parliament offered a huge reward to anyone whose method of measuring longitude could be proven successful. The scientific establishment--from Galileo to Sir Isaac Newton--had mapped the heavens in its certainty of a celestial answer. In stark contrast, one man, John Harrison, dared to imagine a mechanical solution--a clock that would keep precise time at sea, something no clock had been able to do on land. And the race was on....</p><p>Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i> tells the story of how 18th-century scientist and clockmaker William Harrison solved one of the most perplexing problems of history--determining east-west location at sea. This lush, colorfully illustrated edition adds lots of pictures to the story, giving readers a more satisfying sense of the times, the players, and the puzzle. This was no obscure, curious difficulty--without longitude, ships often found themselves so far off course that sailors would starve or die of scurvy before they could reach port. When a nationally-sponsored contest offered a hefty cash prize to the person who could develop a method to accurately determine longitude, the race was on. In the end, the battle of accuracy--and wills--fought between Harrison and arch-rival Maskelyne was ruthless and dramatic, worthy of a Hollywood feature film. <i>Longitude</i>'s story is surprising and fascinating, offering a window into the past, before Global Positioning Satellites made it look easy. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p>A fully illustrated edition of the international best-seller <i>Longitude</i>.</p><p><i>The Illustrated Longitude</i> recounts in words and images the epic quest to solve the greatest scientific problem of the eighteenth and three prior centuries: determining how a captain could pinpoint his ship's location at sea. All too often throughout the ages of exploration, voyages ended in disaster when crew and cargo were either lost at sea or destroyed upon the rocks of an unexpected landfall. Thousands of lives and the fortunes of nations hung on a resolution to the longitude problem.</p><p>To encourage a solution, governments established prizes for anyone whose method or device proved successful. The largest reward of �20,000-- truly a king's ransom-- was offered by Britain's Parliament in 1714. The scientific establishment-- from Galileo to Sir Isaac Newton-- had been certain that a celestial answer would be found and invested untold effort in this pursuit. By contrast, John Harrison imagined and built the unimaginable: a clock that told perfect time at sea, known today as the chronometer. Harrison's trials and tribulations during his forty-year quest to win the prize are the culmination of this remarkable story.</p><p><i>The Illustrated Longitude</i> brings a new and important dimension to Dava Sobel's celebrated story. It contains the entire original narrative of <i>Longitude</i>, redesigned to accompany 183 images chosen by William Andrewes-- from portraints of every important figure in the story to maps and diagrams, scientifc instruments, and John Harrison's remarkable sea clocks themselves.

Yet few realize that this apparently natural landscape is a totally fabricated public space. Two hundred years ago the Charles was a tidal river, edged by hundreds of acres of salt marshes and mudflats. <i>Inventing the Charles River</i> describes how, before the creation of the basin could begin, the river first had to be imagined as a single public space. The new esplanades along the river changed the way Bostonians perceived their city; and the basin, with its expansive views of Boston and Cambridge, became an iconic image of the metropolis.</p><p>The book focuses on the precarious balance between transportation planning and stewardship of the public realm. Long before the esplanades were realized, great swaths of the river were given over to industrial enterprises and transportation&#x2015;millponds, bridges, landfills, and a complex network of road and railway bridges. In 1929, Boston's first major highway controversy erupted when a four-lane road was proposed as part of a new esplanade. At twenty-year intervals, three riverfront road disputes followed, successively more complex and disputatious, culminating in the lawsuits over "Scheme Z," the Big Dig's plan for eighteen lanes of highway ramps and bridges over the river. More than four hundred photographs, maps, and drawings illustrate past and future visions for the Charles and document the river's place in Boston's history.</p></p><p>Karl Haglund is project manager for the New Charles River Basin at the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.<p>In an era when human incursion into the landscape invites trepidation, Karl Haglund's thorough and intriguing<i> Inventing the Charles River</i> arrives to remind us that heroic construction can, in fact, ameliorate it.

Afew feet &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;coast &nbsp;path, it's a twenty-minute scramble &nbsp;from &nbsp;the edge of the estate, far enough &nbsp;from &nbsp;Black Rabbit Hall's watching win� dows, a secret &nbsp;place. I hover on the cliff above it for a moment or two, wind snapping my dress against my legs, soles of my feet tingling, then&nbsp;lower myself carefully, &nbsp;gripping the clumps of grass, sea roaring in my ears.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Best &nbsp;not &nbsp;to &nbsp;look &nbsp;down.) One small &nbsp;heart-stop drop and &nbsp;I'm perching right &nbsp;on the edge of sky.&nbsp;Jump too wide, it's all over. I wouldn't do it. But it occurs to me that&nbsp;I like the fact I could. That I have some control over my destiny today.&nbsp;<br><br> Pressed &nbsp;against &nbsp;the &nbsp;cliff wall, &nbsp;I finally catch &nbsp;my breath. So much frantic searching: woods, &nbsp;rooms, endless &nbsp;stairs. &nbsp;Heels &nbsp;rubbed raw in too-small tennis shoes. &nbsp;And&nbsp; &nbsp;I &nbsp;still &nbsp;haven't &nbsp;found them. Where <i>are </i>they? Shading my eyes from &nbsp;the sky dazzle &nbsp;with &nbsp;my hand, I scan the bottle-green cliff &nbsp;tops &nbsp;on the &nbsp;other side of the &nbsp;cove. Deserted. Only cattle in the fields.&nbsp;I inch&nbsp; down then, spine &nbsp;against the &nbsp;rock, and &nbsp;hitch &nbsp;up &nbsp;my dress,&nbsp;brazenly, &nbsp;so that &nbsp;air tunnels through my bare bent legs.&nbsp;<br><br> Still&nbsp; at last, &nbsp;I can't &nbsp;outrun the &nbsp;events &nbsp;of the &nbsp;day any longer. &nbsp;Even the &nbsp;sound &nbsp;of the &nbsp;waves on &nbsp;the &nbsp;rocks &nbsp;makes &nbsp;my slapped cheek &nbsp;sting&nbsp;afresh. &nbsp;I blink and &nbsp;there &nbsp;is the house, silhouetted on the inside &nbsp;of my eyelids. So I try to keep my eyes open and let my mind loose in the vast pink sky, where the sun &nbsp;and moon &nbsp;hang like a question and an answer. &nbsp;Iforget &nbsp;that &nbsp;Iam &nbsp;meant &nbsp;to &nbsp;be searching. That minutes move faster &nbsp;than clouds at dusk. I think only of my own escape.&nbsp;I don't know &nbsp;how long I sit there, my thoughts pierced &nbsp;by a huge&nbsp;black bird diving &nbsp;over the &nbsp;cliff, so close its talons might &nbsp;catch &nbsp;in &nbsp;my hair. Iinstinctively duck &nbsp;in its wing draft, nose meeting the cool skin of my knees. &nbsp;And &nbsp;when &nbsp;I look up my gaze is no longer &nbsp;on the sky but on flotsam bob bing on the high tide swell below.<br><br> No, not flotsam. Something more alive. A dolphin? Or those &nbsp;jelly�&nbsp;fish that &nbsp;have been washing up in our cove all week, like a lost cargo of gray glass bowls? Maybe. I lean forward, dipping my face over the edge to get a better view, hair &nbsp;blowing &nbsp;wildly, heart &nbsp;beating a little &nbsp;faster, starting to sense something terrible shifting just below the shimmer� ing blue surface, not quite seeing it. Not yet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>Lorna</b><br><b> <i>More than three decades later</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is one&nbsp; of those &nbsp;journeys. &nbsp;The &nbsp;closer &nbsp;they get to their destination, the &nbsp;harder it is to imagine that &nbsp;they'll ever actually arrive. There is always another bend &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;road, &nbsp;a judder &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;dead &nbsp;end of a farm track. &nbsp;And &nbsp;it is getting late, too late. Warm summer rain is drumming&nbsp;on the roof of the car.<br><br> "I say we cut our losses and &nbsp;head back to the &nbsp;Band B." Jon cranes over &nbsp;the &nbsp;steering wheel &nbsp;to get &nbsp;a better view &nbsp;of the &nbsp;road &nbsp;liquefying behind the &nbsp;windscreen. "Grab a pint &nbsp;and &nbsp;plan a wedding somewhere within the M25. &nbsp;What do you reckon?"<br><br> Lorna draws a house with &nbsp;her fingertip in the condensation on the window. &nbsp;Roof. Chimney Squiggle of smoke. "Don't think so, darling."<br><br> "Somewhere with a sunny microclimate, perhaps?"<br><br> "Ha. Funny." &nbsp;Despite the disappointments of the day so far-none of the &nbsp;wedding venues &nbsp;has &nbsp;lived &nbsp;up &nbsp;to &nbsp;expectation, too &nbsp;much &nbsp;over� priced &nbsp;chintz-Lorna is quite &nbsp;happy. There is something exhilarating about &nbsp;driving through this wild weather with &nbsp;the man she is to marry, just the two of them &nbsp;cocooned in their wheezing little &nbsp;red Fiat. When they're old and &nbsp;gray they'll remember this &nbsp;journey, &nbsp;she thinks. Being young and in love and in a car in the &nbsp;rain.<br><br> "Great." Jon &nbsp;frowns &nbsp;at a looming dark &nbsp;shape &nbsp;in the mirror. "All &nbsp;I&nbsp;need &nbsp;now is a massive bloody tractor up &nbsp;my backside." &nbsp;He &nbsp;stops &nbsp;at a crossroads, where various signs, bent &nbsp;by the &nbsp;wind, &nbsp;point &nbsp;in directions that &nbsp;bear little relation to the angle of the corresponding roads. "Now where?"<br><br> "Are we lost?" she teases, enjoying &nbsp;the idea.<br><br> &nbsp;"The satnav &nbsp;is lost. We &nbsp;seem &nbsp;to have gone off grid. &nbsp;Only in your beloved Cornwall."<br> Lorna smiles. &nbsp;Jon's &nbsp;is a &nbsp;boyish, &nbsp;uncomplicated grumpiness, one that &nbsp;will evaporate with &nbsp;the first &nbsp;sign of the &nbsp;house, or a cold beer. &nbsp;He doesn't internalize things, like she does, or make obstacles symbolic &nbsp;of other stuff.<br><br> "Right." He nods at the map on Lorna's lap, which is scattered with biscuit &nbsp;crumbs and &nbsp;folded &nbsp;haphazardly. "How are your &nbsp;map-reading skills coming along, sweetheart?"<br><br> "Well &nbsp;..." She scrabbles the &nbsp;map open, bouncing the crumbs off to join the empty water bottles rolling on the sandy car floor. "According to my rough &nbsp;cartological calculations, we're currently driving through the Atlantic."<br><br> Jon &nbsp;huffs &nbsp;back in &nbsp;his seat, &nbsp;stretches out &nbsp;his legs, too &nbsp;long for &nbsp;the small car. "Brilliant."<br> Lorna leans &nbsp;over, strokes his thigh &nbsp;where muscle fades the denim. She knows &nbsp;he's &nbsp;tired &nbsp;of driving down &nbsp;unfamiliar roads &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;rain, touring wedding venues, this one, farthest away, hardest to find, &nbsp;saved for last. They would &nbsp;be on the Amalfi Coast &nbsp;if she hadn't insisted that they come &nbsp;to Cornwall instead. If Jon's &nbsp;patience &nbsp;is wearing thin, she can hardly blame him.<br> Jon proposed back at Christmas, months ago, pine needles crunch� ing beneath his bended knee. &nbsp;For a long time, &nbsp;that &nbsp;was enough. She loved being engaged, &nbsp;that state of blissful suspension: they belonged &nbsp;to each &nbsp;other, but &nbsp;they &nbsp;still &nbsp;woke &nbsp;up &nbsp;every &nbsp;morning and &nbsp;chose &nbsp;to &nbsp;be<br> together. She &nbsp;worried about&nbsp; &nbsp;jinxing &nbsp;that&nbsp; &nbsp;easy &nbsp;happiness. &nbsp;Anyway, there &nbsp;was no mad rush. &nbsp;They had all the time in the world.<br><br> Then they &nbsp;didn't. When &nbsp;Lorna's&nbsp; &nbsp;mother died &nbsp;unexpectedly in&nbsp;May, grief punched her &nbsp;back to earth and &nbsp;the &nbsp;wedding suddenly felt inescapably, brutally urgent. Her mother's death &nbsp;was a reminder not to wait. Not &nbsp;to put things on hold or forget &nbsp;that &nbsp;a black date is circled &nbsp;on everyone's calendar, flipping ever closer. &nbsp;Disorienting but also oddly life-affirming, it made her want to grab life in her fists, totter through the litter of Bethnal Green Road &nbsp;on a drizzly Sunday morning in her lucky &nbsp;red &nbsp;heels. &nbsp;This morning she &nbsp;wiggled &nbsp;herself &nbsp;into &nbsp;a sunshine�&nbsp;yellow vintage sixties sundress. If she can't &nbsp;wear it now, when?&nbsp;<br><br> Jon changes gears, yawns. "What's the &nbsp;place called again, Lorna?" "Pencraw," she says brightly, &nbsp;trying to keep his spirits up, mindful&nbsp;that &nbsp;if it were up to Jon &nbsp;they'd simply stuff his large, sprawling family&nbsp;into a marquee in his parents' Essex garden and &nbsp;be done with it. Then they'd move down &nbsp;the road, &nbsp;near&nbsp; his adoring sisters-swapping their tiny &nbsp;city &nbsp;flat&nbsp; &nbsp;for &nbsp;a suburban house&nbsp;&nbsp; with &nbsp;a &nbsp;lawn &nbsp;sprinkler-so &nbsp;his mother, Lorraine, could &nbsp;help with &nbsp;all &nbsp;the &nbsp;babies &nbsp;that &nbsp;would &nbsp;swiftly follow. Thankfully, it is not up to Jon. "Pencraw Hall."<br><br> He runs a hand through his corn-colored hair, sun-bleached almost white at the tips. "One more shot?"<br><br> She beams back. She loves this man.&nbsp;<br><br> "To hell with it, let's go this way. We've got a one-in-four chance of getting it right. &nbsp;Hopefully we'll shake the tractor." He &nbsp;presses his foot hard on the gas.<br><br> They don't shake &nbsp;it.&nbsp;<br><br> The &nbsp;rain &nbsp;continues to fall. The windscreen is mashed &nbsp;with &nbsp;cow� parsley petals,&nbsp; pushed &nbsp;into snowy drifts by the squeaking wipers. &nbsp;Lor� na's heart &nbsp;beats a little &nbsp;faster &nbsp;beneath the crisp cotton of her dress.<br><br> Even &nbsp;though &nbsp;she &nbsp;can't&nbsp; &nbsp;see &nbsp;much&nbsp; &nbsp;beyond&nbsp; &nbsp;the&nbsp; &nbsp;rivulets &nbsp;of &nbsp;rain&nbsp;running down the &nbsp;window, &nbsp;she &nbsp;knows &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;wooded &nbsp;valleys, river creeks,&nbsp; and deserted little &nbsp;coves of the Roseland Peninsula lie beyond the &nbsp;glass, &nbsp;and &nbsp;she &nbsp;can &nbsp;sense &nbsp;them &nbsp;already, &nbsp;hulking out &nbsp;there &nbsp;in &nbsp;the mist. She remembers being on these roads as a kid-they visited Corn� wall &nbsp;most &nbsp;summers-and how &nbsp;the &nbsp;sea &nbsp;air &nbsp;would &nbsp;rush &nbsp;through the wound-down window,&nbsp; &nbsp;blowing &nbsp;away the &nbsp;last &nbsp;trapped bits &nbsp;of grimy Greater London, and &nbsp;the stitch &nbsp;of tension on her mother's face.<br><br> An &nbsp;anxious woman, her &nbsp;mother suffered from &nbsp;insomnia all &nbsp;her life: &nbsp;the &nbsp;seaside &nbsp;seemed &nbsp;to &nbsp;be the &nbsp;only &nbsp;place she could &nbsp;sleep. &nbsp;When Lorna was little, she wondered if the Cornish air swirled &nbsp;with strange&nbsp;sleepy &nbsp;fumes, &nbsp;like &nbsp;the &nbsp;poppy &nbsp;field &nbsp;in &nbsp;<i>The Wizard of Oz. &nbsp;</i>Now &nbsp;a small<br> voice in her head cannot help wondering if it swirls with family secrets. But she decides to keep this thought to herself.<br><br> "Are you sure &nbsp;this &nbsp;old pile actually exists, &nbsp;Lorna?" &nbsp;Jon's arms &nbsp;are&nbsp;straight and stiff at the wheel, eyes reddening with strain.&nbsp;<br><br> "It exists." She pulls up &nbsp;her long, dark &nbsp;hair, twisting it into &nbsp;a top� knot. &nbsp;A few strands escape, fringing her pale neck. She feels the heat of his glance: &nbsp;he loves her neck, the soft baby skin &nbsp;just below her ears.<br><br> "Remind me again." His eyes return to the road. "Some old manor&nbsp;house you visited with &nbsp;your m urn while on holiday down here?" "That's right." She nods &nbsp;enthusiastically.<br><br> "Your &nbsp;mum &nbsp;enjoyed &nbsp;a stately, I know that." &nbsp;He &nbsp;frowns up at the mirror. The &nbsp;rain &nbsp;is falling in undulating silver sheets &nbsp;now. "But &nbsp;how can you be sure it's this one?"<br><br> "Pencraw Hall popped up &nbsp;on some &nbsp;online wedding directory. I recognized it straightaway."<br> Already so many &nbsp;things have faded-the hyacinth notes of her mother's favorite &nbsp;perfume, the exact click of her tongue as she &nbsp;searched for &nbsp;her &nbsp;reading glasses-but &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;last &nbsp;few weeks other memories, long forgotten, seemingly random, have come into unexpected bright&nbsp; focus. And this is one of them. &nbsp;"Mum pointing&nbsp;up at this &nbsp;big old house. &nbsp;The &nbsp;look of awe in her eyes. It sort &nbsp;of stuck with &nbsp;me." She &nbsp;swivels &nbsp;the &nbsp;diamond engagement ring &nbsp;on &nbsp;her finger, remembering other things too. &nbsp;A &nbsp;pink-striped paper&nbsp; &nbsp;bag &nbsp;of fudge heavy &nbsp;in &nbsp;her &nbsp;hand. A &nbsp;river. &nbsp;"Yes, &nbsp;I'm &nbsp;almost&nbsp; &nbsp;certain it's &nbsp;the &nbsp;same house."<br><br> <i>"Almost?"&nbsp;</i>Jon shakes his head, laughs, one ofhis big belly laughs that rumble against &nbsp;his ribs.

Original.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Wolf Hall (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic)</h2><p>Winner of the Man Booker Prize 2009 &#39;Lock Cromwell in a deep dungeon in the morning,&#39; says Thomas More, &#39;and when you come back that night he&#39;ll be sitting on a plush cushion eating larks&#39; tongues, and all the gaolers will owe him money.&#39; England, the 1520s. Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is his chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. Into this atmosphere of distrust and need comes Thomas Cromwell, first as Wolsey&#39;s clerk, and later his successor. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events. Ruthless in pursuit of his own interests, he is as ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a self-interested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages. From one of our finest living writers, Wolf Hall is that very rare thing: a truly great English novel, one that explores the intersection of individual psychology and wider politics. With a vast array of characters, and richly overflowing with incident, it peels back history to show us Tudor England as a half-made society, moulding itself with great passion and suffering and courage.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:</strong> No character in the canon has been writ larger than Henry VIII, but that didn't stop Hilary Mantel. She strides through centuries, past acres of novels, histories, biographies, and plays--even past Henry himself--confident in the knowledge that to recast history's most mercurial sovereign, it's not the King she needs to see, but one of the King's most mysterious agents. Enter Thomas Cromwell, a self-made man and remarkable polymath who ascends to the King's right hand. Rigorously pragmatic and forward-thinking, Cromwell has little interest in what motivates his Majesty, and although he makes way for Henry's marriage to the infamous Anne Boleyn, it's the future of a free England that he honors above all else and hopes to secure. Mantel plots with a sleight of hand, making full use of her masterful grasp on the facts without weighing down her prose. The opening cast of characters and family trees may give initial pause to some readers, but persevere: the witty, whip-smart lines volleying the action forward may convince you a short stay in the Tower of London might not be so bad... provided you could bring a copy of <em>Wolf Hall</em> along. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em>Hilary Mantel is one of our most important living writers. She is the author of eleven books, including A Place of Greater Safety, Giving Up the Ghost, and, most recently, Beyond Black, which was shortlisted for the 2006 Orange Prize.</p><h2>Burn Zone</h2><p>It was supposed to be a low-level bust for ATF agent Alex Duarte, with the hope that he could work it up the ladder to someone important.

Born is a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where he is involved with a wide variety of criminal investigations. He has also worked with the U.S. Marshals Service.</p>ATF agent Alex Duarte, who debuted in Born's <i>Field of Fire</i> (2007), remains a man of action but, alas, little else, in his second outing, an otherwise snappy, well-plotted crime drama set in Panama and New Orleans. Duarte and several other federal agents are trying to track down a drug lord known only as Mr. Ort�z, a shadowy Panamanian suspected of shipping tons of marijuana to the U.S. In reality, Ort�z is exporting something far more dangerous: a nuclear bomb. Born, himself a state police officer in Florida, offers the kind of real-life detail one would expect from a law enforcement professional. His previous series, which featured Florida cop Bill Tasker (<i>Walking Money</i>, etc.), stood out from the pack largely because of the layered persona of his protagonist. In contrast, Duarte has the requisite toughness, but aside from being a man of few words&#x2014;particularly around the ladies&#x2014;his character has few distinguishing features. Hopefully, Born will make his hero more a leading man than a background player in subsequent adventures. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During the Cretan revolt of 1897 his family was sent to the island of Naxos, where he attended the French School of the Holy Cross. From 1902 to 1906 he studied law at Athens University. He worked first as a journalist and throughout a long career wrote several plays, travel journals and translations. His remarkable travels began in 1907 and there were few countries in Europe or Asia that he didn&#39;t visit. He studied Buddhism in Vienna and later belonged to a group of radical intellectuals in Berlin, where he began his great epic The Odyssey, which he completed in 1938. He didn&#39;t start writing novels until he was almost 60 and completed his most famous work, Zorba the Greek, in 1946.

He possessed precisely what a pen pusher needs for deliverance: the primitive glance that snatches nourishment lovingly from on high; the creative artlessness, renewed at each daybreak, that views everything unceasingly as though for the first time, bequeathing virginity to the everlastingly quotidian elements of wind, sea, fire, women, and bread; the sureness of hand, the freshness of heart, the gallant stalwart&#x2019;s ability to poke fun at his own soul for seeming to harbor a power higher than the soul; finally, that wild, throaty laugh welling up from a source deeper than a man&#x2019;s inner depths, a laugh that erupted redemptively at crucial moments from Zorba&#x2019;s elderly chest, exploding with sufficient power to demolish (and did demolish) all the barricades&#x2014;morality, religion, nationalism&#x2014;erected around themselves by wretched, lily-livered humans to let them hobble securely through their diminished mini-lives.<br> <br>I can hardly endure my rage and sorrow when I consider what nourishment my famished soul was fed by books and teachers for so many years, and then compare this to the leonine brainpower that Zorba fed me for just a few months. My life was fated to be ruined because I encountered this &#x201c;venerable father&#x201d; too late, when the portion of my inner self still capable of being saved was minimal. The great alteration&#x2014;the definitive change of front, the &#x201c;conflagration&#x201d; and &#x201c;renewal&#x201d;&#x2014;did not take place. The time was already too late. Thus Zorba, instead of becoming an exalted, authoritative model for my life, was sadly debased into a literary subject causing me to fill numerous sheets of paper with splotches!<br> <br>The doleful privilege of turning life into art leads many flesh-eating souls to disaster because ardent passion departs the breast when it finds an outlet of this sort. In such a case the soul experiences relief. It no longer fumes with rage, no longer needs to fight breast to breast, to intervene directly in life or action. Instead, it is pleased to admire its ardent passion as it ascends like smoke rings in the breeze and fades away. The soul not only takes pleasure in this relief; it also grows proud, for it believes that it is accomplishing something grand by supposedly eternalizing the irreplaceable temporary moment, which alone possesses flesh and blood in limitless time. This is how Zorba, so full of flesh and bone, degenerated in my hands into paper and ink. Years ago, the Zorba story, without my wishing it to do so, and, indeed, wishing the opposite, began to crystallize within me. The mystic rites began deep inside me, a musical turbulence at first, a feverish delight and malaise, as though my organism, a foreign body having entered the bloodstream, were struggling to control and annihilate this story through assimilation. Words then began to speed around the nucleus, to encircle and nourish it like an embryo. Blurry memories became clear, sunken joys and sorrows rose to the surface, life was transposed into finer air&#x2014;and Zorba became a tall tale.<br> <br>I still lacked a clear notion of what form to give this tall Zorbatic tale: novel, poem, complex make-believe narrative from the Thousand and One Nights, or something matter-of-fact, dry, reproducing the conversations we had on the Cretan shoreline where we lived and were supposedly digging to find lignite. Both of us well knew that this practical purpose was just a smokescreen for the eyes of outside observers. Neither of us could wait for the sun to set, the workmen to leave, the two of us to stretch out on the sand, eat our delicious village food, drink our dry Cretan wine, and begin to talk.<br> <br>Most of the time I said nothing. What could an intellectual say to an ogre? I would listen to him speak about his village near Mount Olympus, about snow, wolves, terrorists during the Balkan Wars, Hagia Sophia, lignite, magnesite, women, God, patriotism, death. Then, suddenly, when he was choking and no longer able to find room for words, he would leap up onto the beach&#x2019;s rough shingle and start to dance.<br> <br>An old man, erect and bony, his head thrown back, his fully round eyes as tiny as a bird&#x2019;s, he would dance and shriek, stamping his callused soles on the shoreline, his face spattered with seawater.<br> <br>If I had listened to his voice&#x2014;not his voice, his outcry&#x2014;my life would have become worthwhile. I would have experienced with blood, flesh, and bone what I now ponder like a hashish smoker and effectuate with paper and ink.<br> <br>But I did not dare. I would see Zorba dancing at midnight with horse-like whinnies, bellowing at me to slip out of my comfortable shell of prudent habit and to flee with him on great journeys. But I remained motionless, shuddering.<br> <br>Many times in my life I have been ashamed because I caught my soul not daring to do what supreme folly&#x2014;life&#x2019;s essence&#x2014;was calling me to do. But never did I feel so ashamed of my soul as I did when in the presence of Zorba.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>One morning we parted at daybreak. I headed abroad once again, suffering from the incurable Faustian disease of learning. He went north and settled near Skopia, in Serbia, where he apparently unearthed a rich vein of magnesite in a mountainside. He hooked a few investors, purchased tools, recruited workmen, and began once again to open up galleries in the earth. He dynamited boulders, constructed roads, brought water, built a house, and married&#x2014;the lusty old codger!&#x2014;married Lyuba, a frisky, good-looking widow, fathering a child with her.<br> <br>One day when I was in Berlin I received a telegram: &#x201c;FOUND MOST BEAUTIFUL GREEN STONE. COME IMMEDIATELY. ZORBA.&#x201d;<br> <br>Germany was then suffering from intense famine. The Papiermark had fallen so low that you carried sackfuls with millions in them to make a small purchase, and when you went to a restaurant to eat you opened your napkin, which was overfilled with paper currency, and emptied it onto the table in order to pay. The day came when ten billion Papiermarks were required for a postage stamp.<br> <br>Hunger, cold, frayed jackets, tattered shoe soles, red German cheeks turned yellow. An autumn wind blew, and people fell in the streets like leaves. Infants were given a bit of rubber to gnaw as a ruse so they wouldn&#x2019;t cry. Police patrolled the bridges over the river to prevent mothers from jumping in at night to save themselves by drowning.<br> <br>It was winter, snowing. A German professor of Chinese in the room next to mine, in order to keep warm, clasped his long brush and attempted to copy some ancient Chinese poem or a Confucian maxim using the incommodious method of the Far East, by which the tip of the brush, the scholar&#x2019;s delicately elevated elbow, and his heart were required to form a triangle. &#x201c;After a few moments,&#x201d; he used to tell me with pleasure, &#x201c;sweat runs from my armpits and thus I feel warm.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was during those bitter-cold days that I received Zorba&#x2019;s telegram. At first I was annoyed. Millions of people were humiliated and forced to their knees because they lacked a slice of bread to support their spirits and bones, and here comes a telegram telling me to travel a thousand miles to go see a beautiful green stone! &#x201c;Curses on beauty!&#x201d; I said to myself. &#x201c;It is heartless, unable to sympathize with human suffering.&#x201d; But suddenly I was frightened. My annoyance had already dissipated. I felt with horror that Zorba&#x2019;s inhumane outcry was answering another inhumane outcry within myself. A savage vulture in me spread its wings, ready for departure.<br> <br>But I did not depart. Once again, I did not dare. I did not board a train, did not obey the divinely ferocious internal outcry, did not perform a gallant, irrational deed. Following the sensible, frigid, human voice of reason, I took up my pen, wrote to Zorba, and explained.<br> <br>He answered me: &#x201c;Forgive me for saying this, Boss, but you are a pen pusher. You poor creep, you had the chance of a lifetime to see a beautiful green stone, and you didn&#x2019;t see it. By God, sometimes when I have no work to do, I sit down and ask myself, &#x2018;Is there a hell or isn&#x2019;t there?&#x2019; But yesterday, when I received your letter, I said to myself, &#x2018;There sure is a hell for certain pen pushers!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Memories have begun to flow. They are jostling each other, hurrying. The time has come to put things in order, to start &#x201c;The Saint&#x2019;s Life of Alexis Zorba&#x201d; from the beginning. Even the most insignificant events related to him gleam clearly, preciously, in my mind at this moment, darting swiftly like multicolored fish in summer&#x2019;s diaphanous seawater. Nothing of his has been lost to me; everything Zorba touched seems to have become immortal. Yet these days I am suddenly worried. It has been two years since I received a letter from him. He is more than seventy years old; he may be in danger. Yes, he most certainly must be in danger; otherwise I cannot explain why I am governed by an abrupt need to reassemble whatever was his: to remember what he said to me and what he did, immobilizing everything on paper to prevent its disappearance&#x2014;as though I wished to exorcise death, his death. I fear that what I am writing is not a book; it is a memorial.<br> <br>Looking at it now, I realize that it contains all the characteristics of a memorial. The tray with its boiled wheat, the kollyva, is embellished with a thick sprinkling of sugar and the name &#x201c;ALEXIS ZORBA&#x201d; written on top with cinnamon and almonds. I look at this name and all at once the indigo-blue sea of Crete rises up, flooding my mind. Words, laughter, dancing, carousing, concerns, muted conversations at twilight, full, round eyes focused upon me forever with tender disdain as though welcoming me at every moment and also bidding me farewell at every moment.<br> <br>Just as, when we view a decorated memorial tray, disparate memories hang like bunched-up bats in the cave of our heart, so Zorba&#x2019;s ghost, without my desiring this, was complicated from the very start by another much-loved shade, Stassinakis, and behind it unexpectedly by still another, that of a fallen woman, Madame Hortense, kissed a thousand times, her hair dyed a thousand times, whom Zorba and I had met on a sandy Cretan beach by the Libyan Sea.<br> <br>The human heart must surely be a grave that is closed and filled with blood. If it opens, all the inconsolable specters that continually multiply around us, darkening the air, run to it in order to drink, quench their thirst, and return to life. They run to drink our heart blood, knowing that no other resurrection exists.<br> <br>In front of all the rest of them today runs Zorba with gigantic strides, pushing aside the other specters because he knows that the memorial taking place on this day is his own.<br> <br>Let us therefore grant him our blood so that he may be revived.<br> <br>Let us do our best to allow this amazing guzzler, swiller, workhorse, womanizer, and scalawag to remain alive just a little longer&#x2014;the broadest soul, surest body,<br> <br>freest outcry that I ever knew.</p><h2>From Cedar Mountain to Antietam</h2><p>Stated 2nd Edition - full number line.</p><p></p><h2>Patrick Desjarlait: Conversations With a Native American Artist</h2><p>A Chippewa artist discusses his life growing up on a reservation, his military experiences during World War II, and the development of his art</p><p>Grade 6 Up-A combination of autobiographical commentary and background information. Facts about the Chippewas' northern Minnesota lake-country home and occupations are explained and illustrated with photographs and DesJarlait's paintings, but most of the text is devoted to the artist's own words. He tells his story from his birth on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in 1921 through his education and career as a commercial artist. He makes clear his need to develop a personal style with which to record and interpret the customs and crafts of his people, a style that seems influenced by Diego Rivera and the Cubists. This book is useful in its respectful delivery of information about the Chippewas in mainstream America and in demonstrating that individuals of any ethnic group need not develop stereotypes in order to honor that group or to make a successful career in art. The layout incorporates full-color reproductions of DesJarlait's paintings with black-and-white historical photographs and an easy-to-read typeface.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.<p>PreSThis mini-board book features Don Freeman's Corduroy using various methods of locomotion. The familiar bear is clad in green overalls, but suit able clothing or equipment is added to the particular activity, e.g., a fire hat for riding in a toy fire engine, a life jacket for waterskiing, a coat and hat for sledding, etc. Each single- or dou ble-page picture shows a different ac tivity. One or two words identify the toy or article used such as skateboard, swing, roller coaster, airplane, sled, etc. Corduroy fans will no doubt enjoy seeing their favorite bear in a new con text. Small hands will find this easy to hold, but the extremely small size will be difficult to shelve and easy to lose. The slightly larger board books are preferable for library circulation.

Married to Beat poet Michael McClure soon after she arrived in San Francisco in 1954, Joanna McClure became a significant figure in the Beat poetry scene. <br><br>Growing up on a ranch in the Arizona desert, Joanna developed early on a deep sensitivity to the beauty of nature. Her move to San Francisco as a young woman in 1951 launched a lifelong love affair with that city and the poetry it engendered. Thriving on the energy of the Beat movement, the young poet found herself inside a circle of famous poets and great writers in American poetry and American literature, including San Francisco Renaissance poet Robert Duncan and his lover, artist Jess Collins, as well as the Beats Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, and Gary Snyder. She heard Ginsberg's first public reading of "Howl" at the Six Gallery in 1955, and the home she shared with Michael became a gathering place for beatniks.<br><br>Meanwhile, Joanna was developing own body of poetic work, allowing her clear inner voice to guide her. Her poems ardently claim the freedoms her generation struggled to achieve, yet they often do so in a playful and generous voice, reveling in the beauty of the natural world and everyday moments and elegantly celebrating sensuality and intimate love. In the late 1950s she began publishing her work in literary journals and chapbooks, and her first book of poems, <i>Wolf Eyes,</i> was published in 1974. <br><br>Like many of her female Beat poet contemporaries, and American women writers throughout the 20th century, Joanna McClure wrote prolifically yet quietly year after year, even as her life shifted focus to a career in early childhood development and she and Michael divorced. "Poetry is where I keep company with myself," she declares. Now for the first time the full range of McClure's voice is accessible in one volume, spanning the poet's entire writing life.</p><p>JOANNA McCLURE has been writing poetry since the 1950s and worked for 35 years in early childhood development. The author of several poetry collections, she continues to give readings and publish her work in limited-edition chapbooks. The author lives in San Francisco, CA.&#x201c;I envy Joanna McClure's writing without an urge always to say &#x2018;something important.&#x2019; The world out there exists in its stew of good and evil, and she, shocked by it, nevertheless remains in her catbird&#x2019;s nest, parsing her own life&#x2014;a life so fully expressed in these interior monologues.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Lawrence Ferlinghetti, member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Joanna McClure writes with a delightful and charmed authenticity. Fresh, direct, and observant, her honesty and intelligence shine through the decades. She grants herself freedom to observe with an open heart, revealing the story of a life that aims for harmony of spirit, self, and the world around her.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Joanne Kyger, author of <i>About Now: Collected Poems </i>and <i>Strange Big Moon: The Japan and India Journals, 1960&#x2013;1964<br><br></i>&#x201c;A poetry of elusive moments we must fill in, like haiku ... A revelation of deep feelings and a life played for keeps.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Peter Coyote, actor and author of&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Where I Fall</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Joanna McClure grew up on the desert ranch, and her poetry has the same pure, sparse beauty, written with the sharp eye of a naturalist. The body of work gathered here in this book has a subtlety and power that is all too rare in the noisy neon world. &nbsp;Joanna's poems will claim you, and you should let them.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Brenda Knight, author of <i>Women of the Beat Generation<br></i><br>&#x201c;The power in Joanna McClure&#x2019;s poems starts quietly, but so does a nuclear chain reaction. Whether she writes of simple joys, like the pleasure of laughter, or deep feelings, like her love for so many different men and women, McClure shows utmost respect for, and kindness toward, the life both around and inside her.&nbsp; These are poems of precise observation, untainted by prejudgment or emotional outburst, that refuse to let life be seen as one-dimensional, that demand always &#x2018;both sides of the coin.&#x2019; The immediacy of lovemaking is weighed against the governments that &#x2018;turn over like exploding pods&#x2019;; the dark brown delicacy of a sunflower&#x2019;s center against the dark brown depth and terror &#x2018;of Baudelaire Verlaine and Mallarm�.&#x2019; McClure&#x2019;s outwardly quiet life is at times reminiscent of Emily Dickinson, for she finds so much beauty, joy, and imagination in roles that to some might look quite ordinary: lover, wife, mother, teacher, caregiver, and finally, lover again. In fact, it is hard not to envy her unending &#x2018;love affair of the century&#x2019; with the world around her, in which she is overcome to the point of ecstasy in her extraordinary appreciation of the blessedness of every moment. Truly, these poems are a gift of new life, and renewed life, to everyone who reads them.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Gerald Nicosia, author of <i>Memory Babe: A Critical Biography of Jack Kerouac, One and Only: The Untold Story of </i>On the Road,<i> </i>and <i>Night Train to Shanghai</i><br><i><br></i>&#x201c;A clear-eyed compendium of a poet&#x2019;s life path.

It is a rich and wise offering.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;David Meltzer, author of <i>When I Was a Poet</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;These poems are a wholeness of melodious contemplation.

He is a former journalist in Dallas and holds a PhD in American Studies from the University of Texas in Austin. His biography of Owen Wister (Owen Wister: Gentleman of the East, Chronicler of the West), won the Texas Institute of Letters Award for the best non-fiction book of the year by a Texas author.

Due to the expense of the English version--when found--I decided to translate it myself from French, my second language, into English, my first. I&#x2019;ve priced the book, as I do everything I write, at the lowest cost allowed by the publisher. Incredibly, Rocco was a priest, as well as a writer and an Aristotelian philosophy teacher. He wrote Alcibiades the School Boy, as said, in 1630. It&#x2019;s first publication, in 1652, was mostly destroyed due to the filth of its content, and was republished in 1862. It was again found filthy and again largely destroyed. Philotime is modeled after Socrates, and is wonderfully portrayed as being as hypocritical as the great Athenian philosopher himself. The text is considered the world&#x2019;s first homoerotic novel, and I guarantee that it is highly erotic. Many a novice, many a monk, (many a translator), must have passed disquieting days copying it, restless nights mauling it over. The first half of this book recounts the historically accurate life of Alcibiades that I myself wrote following months of research. The second half is the translation of Rocco&#x2019;s oeuvre.</p><p></p><h2>House of Life Rachel Carson At Work</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival.

Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were running one-two. Junior's legendary dad, the driver race fans called "The Intimidator," was close behind in third, blocking anyone who might try to pass. Waltrip couldn't stop thinking about all the times he'd struggled to stay ahead--and the 462 NASCAR Cup races he'd lost without a single win. He'd been a race-car driver all his adult life, following in the footsteps of his brother Darrell, a three-time NASCAR champion. And his losing streak was getting more painful every race. <br><br>But this day, he knew, could be different. He was driving for Dale Earnhardt now, racing as a team with his close friend and mentor. Yet as his car roared toward the finish line, ending that losing streak once and for all, Waltrip had no clue that the greatest triumph of his life could get mired in terrible tragedy. <br><br>This is the story of that fateful afternoon in Daytona, a day whose echoes are still heard today. But the story begins years earlier in a small town in Kentucky, with a boy who dreamed of racing cars, a boy who was determined to go from go-karts to the highest levels of NASCAR. For the first time ever, Michael Waltrip tells the full, revealing story of how he got to Daytona, what happened there, and the huge impact it had on so many in the racing world. He reveals for the first time how his own life changed as he dealt with guilt, faced his grief, and searched for the fortitude to climb into a race car again. It's an inspiring and powerful story, told with Michael's trademark humor, honesty, and irreverence. It's a story of family, fulfillment, and redemption--and well-earned victory in the end.</p><p>Michael Waltrip is a two-time Daytona 500 Champion and one of eight drivers to win more than one Daytona 500. He is an iron horse racer one of three to make a least 1,000 career NASCAR starts. Waltrip was an original member of "This Week in NASCAR," and writes a monthly column for <em>NASCAR Illustrated.</em></p><h2>At Home on the Range</h2><p>While unpacking boxes of old family books recently, Elizabeth Gilbert rediscovered a dusty, yellowed hardcover called At Home on the Range, originally written by her great-grandmother, Margaret Yardley Potter. Having only been peripherally aware of the volume, Gilbert dug in with some curiosity, and soon found that she had stumbled upon a book far ahead of its time. Part scholar and part crusader for a more open food conversation, Potter espoused the importance of farmer&#x2019;s markets and ethnic food (Italian, Jewish, and German), derided preservatives and culinary shortcuts, and generally celebrated a devotion to epicurean adventures. Reading this practical and humorous cookbook, it&#x2019;s not hard to see that Gilbert inherited her great-grandmother&#x2019;s love of food and her warm, infectious prose.<br><br>Proceeds from this book benefit ScholarMatch (scholarmatch.org).<br></p><p><b>Margaret Yardley Potter's</b> book is culled from a lifetime of cooking and entertaining in her home, from the 1920s through World War II. In addition to being a cooking columnist for the <i>Wilmington Star</i>, she also painted, sold dresses, assisted in the birth of four grandchildren, and took up swing piano.<br><br><b>Elizabeth Gilbert</b> is the bestselling author of numerous books, including <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>, now a major motion picture.

Read today--as introduced in a McSweeney's edition by Potter's great-granddaughter, Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert--it is both artifact and artfully useful. Choice bit: Potter who died in 1955 at age 62, liked to invite guests not for dinner but rather for breakfast--'en neglige.'

In her bright, determined tone ( Is your cigarette finished?

This heartfelt work offers an inspiring call for her readers to enter their own "Forest of Remembrance."

While attending high school in Philadelphia she met her husband illustrator JerryPinkney who attributes much of his success to her long-standing involvement in hiswork.<br><br>Over the years Gloria has collaborated with Jerry in making quality books for children. She hashired his models assembled costumes photographed sets and helped him research. Today shecontinues to be closely involved with the illustration process. <i>Back Home</i> marked anew collaboration between the Pinkneys -- the first book written by Gloria and illustrated byJerry the product of a long happy and productive partnership.<br><br> <i>Back Home</i> evolved out of a family reunion in Lumberton North Carolina. Itrekindled some old memories and I realized how much history there was in my own family. WhenI came home and started thinking about it I knew I was ready to write a book. The story is basedon a trip I took to Lumberton when I was eight years old. I named the main character Ernestine after my mother and dedicated the book to her. The book has received widespread acclaim andSmithsonian said that it deserves to become an heirloom. <br><br><i>The Sunday Outing</i> Gloria's latest book is the prequel to <i>Back Home</i>.She says, When I was a youngster my great aunt and I would often spend warm summerSundays at North Philadelphia station. My fantasy while watching the trains pass through was tosomeday board a North Carolina train and visit the place where I was born. In <i>The SundayOuting</i>, through Ernestine, Gloria s dreams become reality. <i>Publishers Weekly</i>said, Gloria Pinkney skillfully captures the fidgety impatience of childhood. <br><br>For the past few years Gloria has been traveling around the country speaking to children andadults about the making of picture books. She lives with her husband Jerry in WestchesterCounty New York and she is currently working on a third book about Ernestine. The Pinkneyshave four adult children, all of whom are working in the creative arts and six grandchildren.Children's book illustrator Brian Pinkney - their oldest son - says of his parents:"They have suchrespect for each other. I think that's why they have been so successful as a couple". copyright ? 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

His current one-man show entitled, "Building Bridges, the Art of Jerry Pinkney" was organized by the Pittsburgh Children's Museum and will be traveling through 1998. Mr. Pinkney has illustrated for a wide variety of clients, including <i>National Geographic</i> , the National Parks Service, the U.S. Postal Service, the <i>American Library Association</i> and the <i>Association of Booksellers for Children</i>.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia in 1939, Jerry Pinkney states, "(I) took an interest in drawing very early in my life, and at some point I realized I'd rather sit and draw than do almost anything else." While growing up in the Germantown section of Philadelphia his interest in art was supported by hisfamily -- especially by his mother. "She certainly understood me and made it clear to everyone that if art was what I wanted to pursue, then that's what she wanted to have happen. My father also became very supportive, and when I wanted to take art classes after school he found ways for me to attend."</p><p>In junior high school Mr. Pinkney had a newsstand and took a drawing pad with him to work every day and sketched passersby. That was how he met the cartoonist John Liney, who encouraged him to draw and showed him the possibilities of making a living as an artist.</p><p>After graduating from the commercial art program at Dobbins Vocational School, where he met his wife, author Gloria Jean Pinkney, Jerry Pinkney received a full scholarship to attend the Philadelphia Museum College of Art (now University of the Arts). While at PCA he and Gloria married. After their first child was born, they moved to Boston, where Mr. Pinkney worked as a designer at Rustcraft Greeting Card Company, and at Barker-Black Studio where he developed his reputation as an illustrator. Eventually he opened Kaleidoscope Studio with two other artists. Later he opened his own freelance studio -- Jerry Pinkney Studio -- and moved to New York. Sensitivity to and an interest in a variety of cultures has always been a dominant theme of Mr. Pinkney s work. He has also drawn inspiration for a significant part of his work from African American culture. Among his numerous projects are his twelve postage stamps for the U.S. Postal Service Black Heritage series. Mr. Pinkney was a member of its Advisory Committee for ten years and he was also invited to join the NASA artist team for the space shuttle Columbia. "I wanted to show that an African American artist could make it on a national level in the graphic arts. I want to be a strong role model for my family and for other African Americans."</p><p>Many of Mr. Pinkney's children's books celebrate multicultural and African American themes. "Working on both the <i>Uncle Remus</i> tales and <i>John Henry</i> has shown me an important link between pivotal and opposite African American folk heroes. Brer Rabbit, the sly trickster, originated during slavery and was the first African American folk hero. Slaves who wanted to get the better of their masters needed to be cunning and sly -- hence the trickster role. However, later comes John Henry, a free man, whose strength and valor bring him fame. He was a strong folk hero for African Americans, a symbol of all the working men who made a major contribution to the building of the roads and railroads in the mountains of West Virginia -- a dangerous job for which many paid with their lives."</p><p>Mr. Pinkney's two latest books are<i>The Little Red Hen</i> and <i>The Old African</i> by Julius Lester (illustrated by Jerry Pinkney). Books give me a great feeling of personal and artistic satisfaction. When I'm working on a book, I wish the phone would never ring. I love doing it. My satisfaction comes from the actual marks on the paper, and when it sings, it's magic".</p><p>Jerry and Gloria Pinkney live in Westchester County, New York. The Pinkneys have four children: Troy, Scott, Brian, and Myles, and seven grandchildren. Two of the Pinkney's children are also involved in children's book illustration, Brian through illustrations, and Myles throughphotography. In addition to illustrating children's books and other projects, Mr. Pinkney has also been an art professor at the University of Delaware and State University of New York at Buffalo. He has given workshops and been a guest lecturer at universities and art schools across thecountry.</p>Gr 9 Up-In a series of 33 reflections on her family and personal life, Pinkney witnesses the presence of God and Jesus Christ in her life. Each vignette is preceded by a biblical quotation, and a Bible verse concludes each entry. All of the stories are drawn from the author's interactions with friends, family, and, occasionally, strangers. Each incident is told with humor and insight. Pinkney's life of disciplined prayer and devotion is reflected in each telling. Readers will find themselves questioning incidents in their own lives and reflecting on whether or not what has happened was luck, a mere coincidence, or a message from a greater power. The author's faith and concern is such that she can find commonalities with other religions and pray for the good of all. Jerry, Brian, and Myles Pinkney's black-and-white artwork and photography enhance this work. This is a very special and personal book that would be suitable wherever personal and family devotions are central to a person's life.<p></p><p><i>Kathryn Kosiorek, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Brooklyn, OH</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Johnny Tractor&#39; s Animal Opposites (John Deere)</h2><p>Read along with Johnny Tractor as he explores the different kinds of animals found around Merriweather Farm, from the big and little to the loud and quiet.

He reflects on the wars against Iraq, the war in Kosovo, the Vietnam War, World War II, and on the meaning of war generally in a world of nations that can't seem to stop destroying each other. These readings appeared first in magazines and newspapers including the Progressive and the Boston Globe, as well as in Zinn's books, Failure to Quit, Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal, The Politics of History, and Declarations of Independence.<br>Here we see Zinn&#x2019;s perspective as a World War II veteran and peace activist who lived through the most devastating wars of the twentieth century and questioned every one of them with his combination of integrity and historical acumen. In his essay, "Just and Unjust War," Zinn challenges us to fight for justice "with struggle, but without war." He writes in "After the War" (2006) that while governments bring us into war, "their power is dependent on the obedience of the citizenry. When that is withdrawn, governments are helpless."

With technical guide. 643 illustrations, including 500 in full color.</p><p>At first glance this massive book seems to be about precious jewelry, not costume jewelry, so beautifully are the over 600 pieces photographed, laid out, and documented. Lengthy signed essays by international experts, including Vivienne Becker ( Art Nouveau Jewelry , 1985), trace the development of costume jewelry as it mirrors artistic styles of this century and introduces trends of its own. From demonstrations of the sinuous grace of turn-of-thecentury Art Nouveau evolving into Art Deco geometrics, through the glamour and glitter of the 1940s and 1950s, to today's freedom from set forms and materials, emphasis is on European and American necklaces and brooches. A production history, lists of manufacturers and identifying marks, guides to techniques and materials, and a glossary round out a volume that belongs in every serious jewelry or fashion history collection.

At their first match in Akron, Ohio, in 1973, Chris was an eighteen-year-old star and Martina, two years her junior, was an unknown Czech making her first trip to the United States. It would be two years before Martina finally beat Chris, and another year&#x2014;after Navratilova had dropped twenty pounds and improved her game&#x2014;before Evert publicly betrayed her first hint of concern. By then, the women were already friends and sometimes doubles partners, and the colorful story that would captivate the world was under way.<br><i>The Rivals </i>is the first book to examine the intertwined journey of these legendary champions, based on extensive interviews with each. Taking readers on and off the courts with vivid, never-before-published material, award-winning sportswriter Johnette Howard shows how Evert and Navratilova came of age during the rambunctious golden age of tennis in the 1970s, and how&#x2014;together&#x2014;they redefined women&#x2019;s athletics during a time of volcanic change in sports and society. Their epic careers unfolded against the backdrop of the fight for Title IX, the gay rights movement, the women's movement and the fall of the iron curtain. Howard draws entertaining, intimate, and myth-shattering portraits of Evert and Navratilova, describing the personal migrations each woman made, and showing how enmeshed their lives became.<br><br>Navratilova and Evert&#x2019;s ability to forge and maintain a friendship during sixteen years of often-cutthroat competition has always provoked wonder and admiration. They were a study in contrasts, a collision of politics and style and looks. Chris was the crowd darling while Martina, her greatest foil, was often cast as the villain. Chris was the imperturbable champion who proved toughness and femininity weren&#x2019;t mutually exclusive; Martina was portrayed as both emotionally fragile and some fearsome Amazon. Chris&#x2019;s off-court life was presumed to be bedrock solid, the stuff of Main Street America; Martina&#x2019;s was derided as outrageous and sometimes chaotic, even during her invincible years. Yet, through it all, the two remained friends who lifted each other to heights that each says she couldn&#x2019;t have reached without the other.<br><br>Women&#x2019;s tennis now is more popular than ever, thanks in large part to the trailblazing of Evert and Navratilova. A rivalry like theirs, filled with so many grace notes, is unique in sports history.</p></p><p>JOHNETTE HOWARD is an award-winning sports columnist for <i>Newsday</i> who previously worked as a senior writer at <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and as a columnist at the<i> Washington Post</i>.

She lives in New York City.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>THE MAKING OF THE ICE PRINCESS<br>In the beginning, it wasn't Chris Evert's idea to play tennis. She was a small, slight girl with a distaste for adventure and an acute shyness around strangers. She was born smack in the middle of the serene and ordered 1950s, came from the most loving and traditional of families, and liked to while away time with her younger sister, painting her nails and brushing each other's hair. The foment and tensions of the 1960s never reached her. She was so sheltered that she recalls her main worries were the boy sitting next to her in class, getting her first serve in, and deciding when she should start wearing a bra. Had her exacting father been an accountant rather than a public parks tennis teaching pro, Evert might have willed herself to become the best CPA of the twentieth century and not a tennis champion. She began her climb on a clay court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at the age of five, hitting each ball that her father lobbed at her from a supermarket cart brimming with hundreds more.<br><br>An uncanny number of legendary athletes speak of having some monumental epiphany as a child, some unforgettable, crystalline moment at which they knew, absolutely knew, that they would go on to do remarkable things and, quite often, they just had to tell somebody about it. Evert's great tennis rival, Martina Navratilova of Czechoslovakia, was already dreaming sugar-plum visions of grandeur by age ten as the drab green commuter trains she rode went hurtling through suburban Prague towns of Dorbrichovice and Zsenory, Mokropsy and Radotin, whisking her toward her lessons with her dashing first coach, George Parma. Tennis star Billie Jean King, Evert's friend and frequent sounding board in the pros, vividly recalls "this burning, tingling, literally white-hot feeling" that came over her one day at five years old, when she was washing dishes with her mother: "All of a sudden I turned to my mother and I said, 'Mom, I am going to do something great one day! I know it! You just watch.' "<br><br>Chris Evert never evinced such certainty as a young girl. Neither did her disciplinarian father, Jimmy, the man who molded her. Jimmy Evert was a two-time U.S. age-group champion who won a tennis scholarship to the University of Notre Dame and notched the best finish of his short-lived postcollege career in 1942, winning the Canadian national championship. In many ways, Jimmy Evert was a character sprung straight from a Frank Capra movie, a man who advocated virtues such as clean living and humility, a doting tennis father who deftly walked the tightrope of having ambitions for his five children without ever making them the casualties of those dreams.<br><br>Jimmy Evert was a staunchly Catholic, conservative man who grew up in Chicago during the Great Depression, endured deprivations like canned food rations as a boy, and never seemed to abandon the rigorous self-discipline that the two enduring influences in his life--his faith and his austere upbringing--demanded. He saw his own father switch from farming to the banking business only to lose nearly everything in the stock market crash of 1929. Though Jimmy and his family lived across the street from the Chicago Town and Tennis Club, the Everts were never members. Jimmy earned his way onto the courts there (and later at the Chicago Armory, one of two indoor facilities in the city) by working as a ball boy for five cents an hour. From the start, tennis enthralled him. He often spent ten hours a day at the courts, sometimes stopping only to rush home for a quick dinner before hurrying back again, with his mother calling after him that he hadn't eaten enough.<br><br>By 1952, the same year he married Colette Thompson, a vivacious woman to whom he was introduced at a friend's wedding, Jimmy was working as the teaching pro at Holiday Park, a twenty-one-court municipal tennis facility in Fort Lauderdale. The features of Chicago and Jimmy's youth--the gunboat gray skies, biting winds, and shoulders hunched against the cold--were a distant memory. Jimmy's daily existence now featured bone-warming sun, swaying palms, and the white sand beaches of the Atlantic Ocean just a few miles away. Yet one of Jimmy's Holiday Park coworkers quickly nicknamed him "Lash" because of his no-nonsense habits. He routinely worked seven days a week, often twelve hours a day. His adult life settled into a contented orbit of work, church, and family, and the same was true for Colette and their five children: Drew, Chris, Jeanne, John, and Clare. Theirs was a quintessentially American, blue-collar existence. "Growing up, we were the most important thing in the world to my parents," Chris said. "What I remember most is the time, the love they gave us."<br><br>Jimmy Evert went to Mass daily, and so did Chris and her four siblings once they began Catholic school. Colette, who is as outgoing as Jimmy is introverted, worked in the school cafeteria and made Chris's tennis dresses. All the Evert children became state champions and age-group national finalists, and all of them eventually made careers in tennis, same as their dad. Chris, who was born on December 21, 1954, shared a childhood bedroom with her sister Jeanne, who is two years younger. The two girls were so close that they would reach across the space between their twin beds and hold hands when a noise frightened them in the middle of the night.<br><br>Jimmy thought it was important to take each of his children onto the courts at Holiday Park as soon as they were able to swing a racket. "There are a lot of great people associated with tennis," he always explained. "And besides, kids need goals. Kids without goals come home from school and just wander. It's not healthy. . . ." He continued, "Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I like to have time to take my kids to the tennis courts and knock balls to them. Why, if a man can feed, clothe, and shelter his family, plus have good health and a lot of fun with his kids, what else does he need?<br><br>"Tennis opened some great doors for me. I thought maybe it would do the same for our kids."<br>Though Chris collected state and national age-group titles from ages eight to sixteen, any convictions about her future as a professional were slow to take hold. She was amassing junior titles, but often only narrowly, her mother says, pulling out finals victories on sheer determination.<br><br>The game that Chris's father taught her was a patient, no-frills baseline style that emphasized limiting errors more than going for flashy winners. Laurie Fleming, a childhood friend and tennis rival, says that for a long time there wasn't one shot in young Chris's arsenal that made anyone say, "Wow." Even Evert's signature two-handed backhand--her most lethal stroke throughout her career--developed by necessity, not as part of some grand design. Jimmy Evert says Chris was too small and weak to hold a racket with one hand when she first started to play. As she got older, Jimmy made several attempts to get her to adopt a one-handed backhand, but, seeing her revert to two hands once she was playing with friends, he finally said, "Forget it."<br><br>If Jimmy had any private, quietly percolating dreams that his daughter might someday mature into someone capable of playing the women's tour, they slowed when Margaret Court, the great Australian champion, came to Holiday Park in 1969 to practice for a nearby women's tournament. Chris was fourteen and still waiting for her first adolescent growth spurt. When Jimmy strolled over to one of the Holiday Park hard courts to watch Court hit with Judy Dalton, another established pro, he thought, "Why, Chrissie can't stay with them at all. They hit the ball so hard! And she's so darn small."<br><br>That was still Jimmy's opinion when Chris won another title--this one the national sixteen-and-under championship--and a sharp-eyed promoter named Clifford Brown telephoned him in September of 1970. Brown was looking to fill out the tournament field in the Carolinas International, his eight-player clay court tournament in Charlotte. He offered to send a Learjet to pick up Chrissie and her friend Laurie Fleming, another top junior player at Holiday Park. To Jimmy, the offer looked to be one of those opening doors that he had always spoken about, a way for his daughter to meet some great people in tennis. Thinking it would be a flattering, unexpected reward for Chris's hard work as well, Jimmy told Brown sure, his daughter could make the trip.<br><br>Knowing that Court, Nancy Richey, and Francoise Durr of France, all world-ranked players, would also be in the field, Colette sent Chrissie off to Charlotte with just one change of clothes.<br><br>"I figured she'd be home the next day," Colette says.<br>When Chris and Laurie Fleming arrived at the private family housing in Charlotte that the tournament had arranged for them, their hosts showed them to their room, and the two girls stayed up well past midnight, talking and laughing and watching television. Their parents had stayed in Fort Lauderdale, telling the girls to be sure to call when their matches were over.<br><br>When Colette answered the telephone the next afternoon, Chris excitedly told her she had beaten Fran�oise Durr, 6-1, 6-0. "You <i>did</i>?" Colette said. She promptly called Jimmy at Holiday Park. "Are you <i>sure</i>?" he asked.<br><br>Durr was the second-best clay court player in the world.<br><br>Chris's next opponent was Margaret Court, the queen of tennis the previous few months because of her just-completed calendar-year sweep of tennis's four major (or "Grand Slam") titles: the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open. Court was twenty-eight years old, she stood nearly six feet tall, and she was famously strong and fit. Her nickname on tour was "The Arm," given to her by five-foot-two Rosie Casals because of her seemingly post-to-post reach at the net. (Casals didn't have a florid imagination.

Among the colorful players, , there's the resilient daughter of a gangster who not only knows how to combine insider trading with running her late father's garbage disposal business, but who, with Cone's help, learns how to keep the business out of the grasping hands of mobsters and stay alive; the financial tycoon so universally hated it takes a Cone to pick the person who really "offed" him from among all those who wanted to; and the case of the mysterious rise in the stock of a Chinese food company, the investigation of which puts Cone in the crossfire of murderous Chinese gangs. What Sanders (The Anderson Tapes, The Fourth Deadly Sin, The Timothy Files) doesn't know about insider trading, crooked takeover bids, blackmail, greenmail and the way cops and racketeers think and talk is nobody's business.

I first encountered his all-but-silent presence at these auditions&#x2014;the first of which he held with the director Brian De Palma. Brian was casting his horror film Carrie, and they both required an actress between the age of eighteen and twenty-two. I was the right age at the right time, so I read for both George and Brian.<br> George had directed two other feature films up till then, THX 1138, starring Robert Duvall, and American Graffiti, starring Ron Howard and Cindy Williams. The roles I met with the two directors for that first day were Princess Leia in Star Wars and Carrie in Carrie. I thought that last role would be a funny casting coup if I got it: Carrie as Carrie in Carrie. I doubt that that was why I never made it to the&nbsp;next level with Carrie&#x2014;but it didn&#x2019;t help as far as I was concerned that there would have to be a goofy film poster advertising a serious horror film. <br> I sat down before the two directors behind their respective desks. Mr. Lucas was all but mute. He nodded when I entered the room, and Mr. De Palma took over from there. He was a big man, and not merely because he spoke more&#x2014; or spoke, period. Brian sat on the left and George on the right, both bearded. As if you had two choices in director sizes. Only I didn&#x2019;t have the choice&#x2014;they did. <br> Brian cleared his bigger throat of bigger things and said, &#x201c;So I see here you&#x2019;ve been in the film Shampoo?&#x201d; <br> I knew this, so I simply nodded, my face in a tight white-toothed smile. Maybe they would ask me something requiring more than a nod. <br> &#x201c;Did you enjoy working with Warren?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Yes, I did!&#x201d; That was easy! I had enjoyed working with him, but Brian&#x2019;s look told me that wasn&#x2019;t enough of an answer. &#x201c;He was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; <br> What was he? They needed to know! &#x201c;He helped me work&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lot. I mean, he and the other screenwriter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they worked with me.&#x201d; Oh my God, this wasn&#x2019;t going well. <br> Mr. De Palma waited for more, and when more wasn&#x2019;t forthcoming, he attempted to help me. &#x201c;How did they work with you?&#x201d; <br> Oh, that&#x2019;s what they wanted to know! &#x201c;They had me do the scene over and over, and with food. There was eating in the scene. I had to offer Warren a baked apple and then I ask him if he&#x2019;s making it with my mother&#x2014;sleeping with her&#x2014;you know.&#x201d; <br> George almost smiled; Brian actually did. &#x201c;Yes, I know what &#x2018;making it&#x2019; means.&#x201d;<br> I flushed. I considered stopping this interview then and there. But I soldiered on. <br> &#x201c;No, no, that&#x2019;s the dialogue. &#x2018;Are you making it with my mother?&#x2019; I asked him that because I hate my mother. Not in real life, I hate my mother in the movie, partly because she is sleeping with Warren&#x2014;who&#x2019;s the hairdresser. Lee Grant played my mom, but I didn&#x2019;t really have any scenes with her, which is too bad because she&#x2019;s a great actress. And Warren is a great actor and he also wrote the movie, with Robert Towne, which is why they both worked with me. With food. It sounded a lot more natural when you talk with food in your mouth. Not that you do that in your movies. Maybe in the scary movie, but I don&#x2019;t know the food situation in space.&#x201d; The meeting seemed to be going better. <br> &#x201c;What have you done since Shampoo?&#x201d; George asked.<br> &nbsp;I repressed the urge to say I had written three symphonies and learned how to perform dental surgery on monkeys, and instead told the truth. <br> &#x201c;I went to school in England. Drama school. I went to the Central School of Speech and Drama.&#x201d; I was breathless with information. &#x201c;I mean I didn&#x2019;t just go, I&#x2019;m still going. I&#x2019;m home on Christmas vacation.&#x201d; <br> I stopped abruptly to breathe. Brian was nodding, his eyebrows headed off to his hair in something like surprise. He asked me politely about my experience at school, and I responded politely as George watched impassively. (I would come to discover that George&#x2019;s expression wasn&#x2019;t indifferent or anything like it. It was shy and discerning, among many other things, including intelligent, studious, and&#x2014; and a word like &#x201c;darling.&#x201d; Only not that word, because it&#x2019;s too young and androgynous, and besides which, and most important, George would hate it.)<br> &#x201c;What do you plan on doing if you get one of these jobs you&#x2019;re meeting on?&#x201d; continued Brian. <br> &#x201c;I mean, it really would depend on the part, but&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . I guess I&#x2019;d leave. I mean I know I would. Because I mean&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I know what you mean,&#x201d; Brian interrupted. The meeting continued but I was no longer fully present&#x2014;utterly convinced that I&#x2019;d screwed up by revealing myself to be so disloyal. Leave my school right in the middle for the first job that came along? <br> Soon after, we were done. I shook each man&#x2019;s hand as I moved to the door, leading off to the gallows of obscurity. George&#x2019;s hand was firm and cool. <br> I returned to the outer office knowing full well that I would be going back to school. &#x201c;Miss Fisher,&#x201d; a casting assistant said. I froze, or would have, if we weren&#x2019;t in sunny Los Angeles. &#x201c;Here are your sides. Two doors down. You&#x2019;ll read on video.&#x201d; My heart pounded everywhere a pulse can get to. <br> The scene from Carrie involved the mother (who would be memorably played by Piper Laurie). A dark scene, where the people are not okay. But the scene in Star Wars&#x2014;there were no mothers there! There was authority and confidence and command in the weird language that was used. Was I like this? Hopefully George would think so, and I could pretend I thought so, too. I could pretend I was a princess whose life went from chaos to crisis without looking down between chaoses to find, to her relief, that her dress wasn&#x2019;t torn.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have no recollection now of how I felt reading the two scenes. I can only assume I beat myself up loud and long. Did they like me? Did they think I was fat? Did they think I looked like a bowl of oatmeal with features? Four little dark dots in one big flat pale face (&#x201c;Me pale face&#x2014;you Tonto&#x201d;). Did they think I looked pretty enough? Was I likable enough for me to relax at all? Not on your life. Because (a) there was no relaxing anywhere in my general area, and (b) there was no relaxing anywhere in show business. <br> But George must have thought I did well enough to have me back. They sent me the Star Wars script so I could practice it before the last reading. I remember opening the manila envelope it came in very carefully, one edge at a time, before removing its unknown cargo. It didn&#x2019;t look any different from other scripts&#x2014;cardboard-like paper on each end, protecting the ordinary paper within&#x2014;covered in antlike scratches of letters. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I wanted to read this screenplay out loud. <br> Enter Miguel Ferrer. Miguel wasn&#x2019;t certain that he wanted to be an actor yet&#x2014;like me. But we were both intrigued enough that we continued exploring. Like me, he came from a show business background. His father was the actor Jos� Ferrer and his mother the singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. We were friends, and I called him up and asked him to read this script with me. He arrived at my mother&#x2019;s newer, much smaller house&#x2014;since her dramatically reduced financial circumstances due to a second failed marriage&#x2014;and we went to my bedroom on the second floor. <br> Like every young man wanting to be an actor in Hollywood then, he had also read for the film, so both of us were dimly aware what we were in store for. We sat on my bed and began to read. From the first page&#x2014;STAR WARS: A SPACE FANTASY&#x2014;the images and characters jumped off the pages. Not only into our minds, but into the chairs and other furniture that surrounded us. I&#x2019;m exaggerating (a little) but it could have jumped onto the furniture, eaten all of it, and drank the blood of an Englishman&#x2014;because it was as epic as any fee-fi-fo-fum rhyme you ever heard. <br> The images of space opened around us, planets and stars floated by. The character I was reading for, Leia, was kidnapped by the evil Darth Vader&#x2014;kidnapped and hung upside down when the smuggler pilot Han Solo (who Miguel was reading for) and his giant monkey creature copilot Chewbacca rescued me. I had been (in the script) upside down and unconscious with yellow eyes. I&#x2019;ll never forget that image. Whoever got the part of the princess named Leia would get to do this. I would potentially get to do this! Maybe&#x2014;if I was lucky&#x2014;I would be rescued by Han and Chewbacca (Chewie!) from the caverns underneath wherever they&#x2019;d tortured me, and Chewie would carry me, slung over his shoulder through thigh deep water as we made it out of (interplanetary) harm&#x2019;s way.<br> Unfortunately, none of this imagery was ever realized due to a combination of cost and the fact that Peter Mayhew&#x2014;who they hired to play Chewie&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t do the stunt due to his extreme height of over 7 feet. He had a condition that left him unable to stand up quickly and remain stable; it was impossible for him to lift up weight of any kind. And my weight, as everyone at Lucasland can recall, was, and remains, of the &#x201c;any kind&#x201d; variety. <br> But I can safely say that any girl cast in the part of the feisty Princess Leia would&#x2019;ve been of the any kind size&#x2014; because once Peter was cast, the lifting and being carried through those thigh-high drenched caverns was out. But I also recall hearing that the water-engulfed caverns were quite an expensive set to build, and this was a low-budget film, so they were out for that reason&#x2014;leaving only Leia&#x2019;s unconsciousness and those yellow eyes. Most of us know how inexpensive unconsciousness is or was to achieve, so that wouldn&#x2019;t have been a budget problem&#x2014;just inappropriate. But by the time you lose Peter&#x2019;s inability to carry any feisty princess and consider the cost-ineffective underground water caverns&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t matter how beautifully you can portray insensibility&#x2014;it ain&#x2019;t happening anyway. <br> The Force was put in me (in a non-invasive way) by the script that day with Miguel, and it has remained in me ever since. I ended up reading for the film with a new actor, an actor I&#x2019;d never seen before, but then he had never seen me, either. I&#x2019;ll bet since that reading with me he&#x2019;s rued the day&#x2014;if he can get his strong hands on a rue that is&#x2014;and if anyone could get their hands on a rue or a Woo it was Harrison Ford. We read together in a room in that same building I&#x2019;d met George and Brian De Palma in. I was so nervous about the reading I don&#x2019;t remember much about Harrison, and given how nervous Harrison would come to make me, that was plenty frightened indeed.<br> The following week, my agent, a man who&#x2019;d been my mother&#x2019;s agent, Wilt Melnick, and was now mine, called me. <br> &#x201c;Carrie?&#x201d; he asked. <br> I knew my name. So I let him know I knew it. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said in a voice very like mine. Mine but hollow, mine but it didn&#x2019;t matter because my stomach had swung into action. <br> &#x201c;They called,&#x201d; he said. <br> Great, &#x2019;cause that was really all I wanted to know. If they called, that they called, not what they said&#x2014;that didn&#x2019;t matter. <br> &#x201c;They want you,&#x201d; he continued. <br> There was a silence. <br> &#x201c;They do? I mean they did?&#x201d; <br> He laughed, then I laughed and dropped the phone and ran out into the front yard and into the street. It was raining. It didn&#x2019;t rain in L.A. It was raining in L.A. and I was Princess Leia. I had never been Princess Leia before and now I would be her forever. I would never not be Princess Leia. I had no idea how profoundly true that was and how long forever was. <br> They would pay me nothing and fly me economy&#x2014;a fact that would haunt my mother for months&#x2014;but I was Leia and that was all that truly mattered. I&#x2019;m Leia&#x2014;I can live in a tree, but you can&#x2019;t take that away from me. <br> I never dreamt there actually might be a day when I maybe hoped that you could</p><h2>Forces of Destiny: Psychoanalysis and the Human Idiom</h2><p>Christopher Bollas is one of the most expressive and eloquent exponents of the ideas, meanings and experience of psychoanalysis currently writing in English.

Soon after returning to Ion, the family s doctor encourages them to spend the debilitating summer months at Crags, a friend s mountain home in upstate New York along the Hudson River. Although she loves her dear friend, Lucy Ross, Elsie s only hesitancy is that her children will be influenced in a negative way knowing that the Rosses have not brought up their children in the love of the Lord, rendering them unruly and disrespectful. With no other alternative, Elsie consents, and they are presented with many opportunities to share the love and truth of Christ amidst the turmoil of the Ross children. Soon after they return to Ion, they are faced with a life-threatening injury to an elder Dinsmore, and later yet, must trust the loving Savior completely with the precious life of their youngest one.</p> <p>Elsie s Children is the sixth book in the original, unabridged nineteenth century Martha Finley classic, the Elsie Dinsmore Series. These books are best when read in order.</p></p><p>Hibbard Publications is dedicated to bringing Martha Finley's 28 books in Dodd Mead's originally published series of The Elsie Books to a new generation of young readers! Here they are, complete and unabridged. They will speak to the hearts of girls and young women as much today as they did when first published in the late 1800's. With no updating for today's reader, these classic originals give an honest view of the writing style and subjects of the nineteenth century American mind. <p>Martha Finley penned the adventures of Elsie Dinsmore, over more than 38 years, often using members of her own family for characterization. Truth, faith, religion, morality, and humanity are the underlying virtues woven throughout the storytelling of this extraordinary series of fiction for children. </p><p>As Miss Finley's stories evolve, Elsie Dinsmore is faced with a myriad of trials and tribulations. Elsie's devout faith and clear knowledge of Scipture enable her to persevere through each troublesome circumstance. As Elsie matures into a godly woman, so her unique family grows, adding to the lovable - and sometimes not so likeable - cast of Miss Finley's interesting characters. </p><p>In 1868, the New York firm of Dodd Mead released the first "Elsie" book, Elsie Dinsmore, becoming an instant bestseller. The successful series, The Elsie Books, was launched, making Finley one of the most renowned children's writers of her time, with book sales second only to Louisa May Alcott. By 1945, 5 million copies of volumes 1-12, alone, had been sold. </p><p>Hibbard Publications is honored to bring back this series of timeless classics, full of the family values and personal faith that are jeopardized in today's society. We hope The Elsie Books will inspire today's reader, as they have for generations, to find richer relationships with the members of their family and with the Lord.</p>With this volume, bringing the story of Elsie and her children down to the present time, the series closes. <p>It was not by request of the author's personal friends, that either this or any one of the previous volumes was written, but in acquiescence to the demands of the public - friends and admirers of Elsie herself. We know that as child, young girl, as wife and mother, she has had many friends who have been loath to part with her. May they find neither Elsie nor her children less lovable in this, than in the earlier volumes, and may their society prove sweet, comforting and helpful to many readers and freinds both old and new.</p></p><h2>40 oz.

Reprint.</p><p>This expanded version of the late Asimov's classic 1958 tale is a collaborative effort that surpasses the original. There are no plot surprises; the authors have retained the basic story of an alien four-year-old child who is kidnapped from his time zone and brought into a future world. Yet this is a fresh and satisfying version, primarily because the characters have been made richer, the depiction of 21st-century society rounded out and the history of the Neanderthal tribe from which the eponymous boy was abducted more fully given. When the woebegone waif, now named Timmie, was snatched from his epoch, he was brought into a pool of no-time, which exists coincident with the present. Since Timmie is condemned to living within that pool forever, his presence raises moral questions: Is it abusive to leave him alone in this limbo for eternity? Would it be equally cruel to send him back to the Ice Age? Asimov ( Foundation ) and Silverberg ( Lord Valentine's Castle ) explore these issues in an intriguing story supported by seamless writing. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Yankee Stranger</h2><p>Volume 2 of The Williamsburg Series</p><p><b>Elswyth Thane </b>(1900&#x2013;1984) was the author of over 30 books of fiction and nonfiction.

When General George Washington appointed Benedict Arnold military commander of the Philadelphia region, military historian Palmer argues, he was not only making one of the worst personnel decisions of his career, but was also creating the conditions for the &#34;Traitor of America&#34; to commit his crime. Stark contrasts and similarities between two men show how their choices informed their destiny. The son of an alcoholic, Arnold became a wealthy merchant before he took up arms against the British, but distinguishing himself on the battlefield was not enough to earn Arnold the prestige he perpetually sought. Washington, who grew up on a tranquil farm, was the beneficiary of guidance from influential figures and was groomed to be a leader. Palmer has a talent for building momentum and suspense, but his most skilled turn is as profiler of the military comrades who would later be foes.</p><p>Two great patriots. Two giants of the battlefield. Yet one became our greatest hero, and one became our most notorious traitor. In this enthralling new dual biography&#x2014;one of the very few to deal with Benedict Arnold&#x2014;military historian and former superintendent of West Point Dave R. Palmer shows how and why George Washington became the father of our country while Benedict Arnold became a man without a country.<p> It was a surprising turn of events. No man was more ardent for the patriot cause and more recklessly brave on the battlefield than Benedict Arnold. After the first three years of the Revolutionary War, every patriot recognized as our two greatest warriors George Washington, commander of the Continental Army, and twice battle-wounded Benedict Arnold, captor of Fort Ticonderoga, invader of Canada, and victor at the battle of Saratoga. Washington and Arnold admired each other. Washington saw Arnold as a true fighting soldier whose merits were unjustly neglected by his superiors and the Continental Congress. Arnold respected Washington as a worthy commander in chief. They even shared enemies&#x2014;both men were subject to jealous conspiracies against them from plotting generals and petty politicians (including, in Washington&#x2019;s case, John Adams). But while Washington rose above his enemies, Arnold became embittered by them. With a character less stoic than Washington&#x2019;s, in pain from his battlefield wounds, and with slow twists of mind, heart, character, and decision, Arnold, in charge of Fortress West Point, finally committed himself to betraying the cause that he had previously served so well. In dramatic fashion, George Washington and Benedict Arnold: A Tale of Two Patriots unveils a chapter of American history that rivals any novel or film for action, intrigue, and romance. It is a story that few Americans know, but that every American should.</p>Dave R. Palmer is a retired lieutenant general of the United States Army, two-tour veteran of Vietnam, former superintendent of West Point, and accomplished military historian specializing in the campaigns of George Washington and the eighteenth-century American army. He often appears as a commentator in television documentaries on the Revolutionary War period and its generals and is the author of many books, including The Summons of the Trumpet: U.S.-Vietnam in Perspective; The Way of the Fox: American Strategy in the War for America, 1775�-1783; and George Washington: First in War.

French Lick Springs Hotel and West Baden Springs Hotel were once rustic stopovers in pre-civil war French Lick and West Baden Indiana --side by side tiny towns in what is called Springs Valley. In the last half of the 19th Century they were fierce rivals attracting visitors to partake of the mineral wells, and with the arrival of the Monon Railway in 1889, a new building boom began that created two spectacular grand hotels by the early 20th Century. It&#39;s also about the wide range of personalities: those who picked presidents, those early characters who ran the hotels, those behind illegal gambling and prostitution, such as the country&#39;s biggest bootlegger Al Capone. It&#39;s also about those stars of stage and screen who headed up huge war bond drives, and the many others that take us up to the 21st Century when the grand hotels of Springs Valley are miraculously born again when Indiana billionaire Bill Cook undertook the largest renovations in hotel history.

Others, such as Piero della Francesca's work in Arezzo and Benozzo Gozzoli's Chapel of the Magi in Florence, have been reproduced countless times. Yet no publisher &#x2014; until now &#x2014; has attempted to gather together and document in extensive photographs the essential fresco cycles of the early Italian Renaissance. The list of works covers the regions of Italy, from the Alpine mountain areas to Puglia, with an emphasis on Tuscany and Florence, the artistic center that gave life to the Renaissance.<br> <i>Italian Frescoes: The Early Renaissance</i> opens with a concise introductory text discussing various aspects of fifteenth-century fresco painting: artists, patronage, cultural and historical conditions, technical methods, and questions of local tradition. The central section of the book examines twenty-one fresco cycles, each representing a crowning achievement in this field. A descriptive and interpretive essay introduces each cycle and is followed by a series of full-page and double-page color plates-many of them new photography of recently restored frescoes-covering the entire work. This parade of colorful masterpieces, paired with Steffi Roettgen's authoritative text, makes a brilliant volume that will be treasured by scholars and art lovers alike. A second volume, Professor Roettgen's<i> Italian Frescoes: The Flowering of the Renaissance</i>, continues the story with works by Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, and many others.</p><p>Steffi Roettgen has taught at the Technical University of Berlin and the University of Munich, where she currently lectures on fifteenth- to eighteenth-century Italian art.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Motivational Interviewing Training for Health Professionals: Supporting Patients Toward Behavior Change</h2><p>This workbook teaches health professionals how to use motivational interviewing to inspire behavior change among their patients.</p><p>Dr. Christine Thorpe is department chairperson and assistant professor in the Health and Human Services Department at New York City College of Technology/City University of New York.

He is a cat; she is a little girl who would like to own him because "he's just my age." Unfortunately, Duncan isn't as enthusiastic about the partnership. And little wonder: Dolores is a miniature cyclone in action, and her boisterousness is odious to Duncan, who definitely does not want to play dress up or do tricks. Discouraged because Duncan seems to prefer older sister Faye, Dolores decides to ignore her cat, with surprising results. Samuels' watercolor illustrations, particularly Duncan's drolly dismayed face, are full of expression and wonderfully complement this rib-tickling story. Faye's deadpan asides as she tries to ignore the chaos will also elicit chuckles. This is a must for cat lovers, but even those who aren't aficionados will find this cat-astrophic tale purr-fectly delightful. Kathleen Brachmann, Highland Park Public Lib . , Ill.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The heroines of Faye and Delores are getting a little older; Delores feels ready to take on the responsibility of owning a cat named Duncan. "He's just my age" is Delores's most persuasive argument. But Dolores's abundant energy and eagerness to be friends with Duncan prove a little daunting to the fat cat; he shows a decided preference for the more sedate Faye. Discouraged, Delores makes a hiding place of two chairs and a blanket, has a tea party with dolls Martha and Mabel (Duncan isn't invited), plays the piano (and doesn't even glance Duncan's way), works at her easel (her pictures aren't of cats). Finally Duncan makes an irresistible overture of friendship and puts his chin on Delores's neck at bedtime. It's a funny first lesson in playing hard-to-get, and Samuel's quirky insights into the siblings' daily lives should have a lot of sistersand brotherslaughing. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pottery Barn Bathrooms</h2><p>Offering a room-by-room tour of well-designed bathrooms, this practical and inspirational guide explains how to create a stylish, comfortable, and efficient bathroom that will suit one&#39;s individual taste and and needs, and includes advice on selecting fittings, fixtures, color schemes, materials, and furnishings, all complemented by 250 original, full-color photographs.</p><p>Over the past 50 years, Pottery Barn has developed a reputation as a home furnishing chain with its own distinctive, elegant designs.

Delays caused by the Spanish allowed Victor to withdraw, whilst promised supplies also did not arrived, and a combined French force gathered opposite Wellesley's position that now outnumbered the Anglo-Spanish force.<br>The French army's nominal commander was King Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, but marshals Victor and Jourdain exercised the actual command. On the night of the 27th the French launched their first attacks, followed up by a general assault on the 28th. Although Wellesely's forces were outnumbers, and a sizeable contingent of the Spanish ran away, he had chosen a superb defensive position and was able to beat off successive French attacks, though at a heavy cost in terms of casualties. Although the French had withdrawn leaving Wellesley the master of the field, his high casualties and approaching French reinforcements led to Wellesley withdrawing to Portugal. His foray into Spain had an enormous effect on Spanish morale as they realized they were not alone in the struggle. British redcoats had had got to within 70km of Madraid, and they would return in future years.</p></p><p>Ren� Chartrand was born in Montreal and educated in Canada, the United States and the Bahamas.

No man will take a wife who towers head and shoulders above him. She lives in isolation with her father, until she is discovered by the Philistine priests. They betroth her to Goliath, to give him warrior sons. What happens when Nara's fate collides with that of David, who is destined to face Goliath in combat, will forever transform how you experience this pivotal moment in the Bible... </p><p>Boorstin reimagines David's dangerous path from shepherd to charismatic leader, interweaving his life not only with Nara's, but with key Biblical characters including King Saul, and Saul's daughter Michal, who will later become David's wife. While faithful to the spirit of the Bible, Boorstin reads between the lines of the ancient narrative to bring immediacy, relevance and even greater meaning to the life of the young Israelite who would become the most beloved character in the Old Testament. David and the Philistine Woman combines exciting storytelling and rich characters to fashion an unforgettable epic.</p> FINALIST in the 2017 Next Generation Indie Book Awards<br></p><p><b>What drew you to the story of David and Goliath as the basis for your novel?</b>Growing up in Chicago as a Jewish kid with thick glasses and zero athletic ability, I was always the last to be picked for baseball, football, soccer--you get the idea. So when I learned at temple about young David triumphing over the giant Goliath, I knew who my role model was! And David is still my hero. My novel examines what it takes to be a true hero, someone of moral character as well as physical daring.<b>How did your experience as a documentary filmmaker affect the way you approached the subject?&nbsp;</b>Working with camera crews around the world under difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions, I learned that what is happening outside the narrow frame of the camera--both behind the scenes, and in the human heart--can be more important than what finally appears on film or video. In the same way, starting with one of the world's most beloved stories--only a few paragraphs in the Bible--I felt I had to reach beyond it. I felt compelled to reimagine the panorama of conflict that raged during this crucial turning point in ancient history.<b>How closely do the characters and story points in your novel adhere to the Biblical account of David and Goliath, and in what ways did you take liberties?</b>No liberties were taken! I used my imagination to dig deeply into the story and explore its most provocative possibilities. The resulting novel, my personal vision, is the product of that journey. And I'm grateful to say that the enthusiastic reaction from rabbis including David Wolpe suggests that they have found inspiration as well as entertainment in it.<b>Why the importance of women in your novel?&nbsp;</b>I believe that the role of women as a moral anchor in the Bible cannot be overstated. Of course, that role was not as openly discussed in ancient times as it is today. So in reimagining the story of David and Goliath, I saw the part played by women as crucial. In my novel, the women of David's time risk their lives for what they believe is right, just like the women of today, whether or not they always get the credit they deserve.<b>Why did you choose to focus not just on the God of the Israelites in your novel, but on the gods of other peoples of that time?</b>For us to truly understand just how revolutionary Judaism was in that era of idol worship, I believe we have to experience the broader landscape of other gods of that era. The clash of religions in my novel is as fierce as the clash of the Israelites against the Philistines, and it will change the world. &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Who do you see as the audience for your novel?&nbsp;</b>The clash of David and Goliath is one of the best-known stories in the world, so I consider the world my audience. I believe that my novel's story of courage, self-discovery and sacrifice reaches across religions and cultures.<b>What do you hope readers will learn from reading David &amp; the Philistine Woman?</b>There's "learn" and there's "experience." First of all, I want readers to experience what life might have been like in those distant times, understanding that, to my mind, human nature has not changed in the thousands of years since. As far as what readers can "learn" from the novel, that is for each reader to decide. One theme that I hope to convey is this: Whether or not we look to God for miracles, it is for each of us to do all that is in our power to help defeat Evil in our own time, as young David did in his.<b>What attracted you to the cover image of the young woman who represents the character of the Philistine woman Nara in your novel?&nbsp;</b>This ancient mosaic from the Eastern Mediterranean comes from the same region as the setting of the novel. What spoke to me was the haunting look in the woman's eyes--the look of a woman who is afraid, but who has the strength to triumph over her fear.<b>Are you working on a sequel to David &amp; the Philistine Woman?</b>Yes! It's a companion piece about the dangerous struggle of another renowned and beloved figure in the Bible at another decisive turning point in ancient history. The story will be told from a fresh perspective and written with the goal of offering the reader a compelling experience. I can promise that if you liked David and the Philistine Woman, you will enjoy it every bit as much!Paul Boorstin is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and screenwriter whose work has appeared on Discovery, A&amp;E and&nbsp;the History Channel, as well as on NBC, ABC and CBS.

As one of the first writers in the United States to claim black feminism for black women, Barbara Smith has done groundbreaking work in defining black women&#x2019;s literary traditions and in making connections between race, class, sexuality, and gender.<br>Smith&#x2019;s essay &#x201c;Toward a Black Feminist Criticism,&#x201d; is often cited as a major catalyst in opening the field of black women&#x2019;s literature. Pieces about racism in the women&#x2019;s movement, black and Jewish relations, and homophobia in the Black community have ignited dialogue about topics that few other writers address. The collection also brings together topical political commentaries on the 1968 Chicago convention demonstrations; attacks on the NEA; the Anita Hill&#x2013;Clarence Thomas Senate hearings; and police brutality against Rodney King and Abner Louima. It also includes a never-before-published personal essay on racial violence and the bonds between black women that make it possible to survive.</p><p>Barbara Smith is co-founder and publisher of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press. She has edited three major collections about Black women, including Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology(Rutgers University Press), and is co-editor with Wilma Mankiller, Gwendolyn Mink, Marysa Navarro, and Gloria Steinem of The Reader&#39;s Companion to U.S. Women&#39;s History."Smith's book is an excellent example of powerful, introspective writing that challenges readers to reexamine their stance on complex ..." -- <i>The Bloomsbury Review</i><br><br>At every moment of serious political crisis- and no thinking person can argue that ours is not such a moment- certain writers step forward with words that seem to ring from the very heart of history. Barbara Smith is certainly one of these writers, and her new book, electrifying, thought-provoking, illuminating, eloquent, harsh, and funny, is essential reading. Whether you agree with everything she says is not important; the essays in this book will revivify your heart and mind and reawaken a passion for activism and for justice. -- <i>Tony Kushner, playwright</i><br><br>Barbara Smith is visionary, courageous, and insightful. Her work provides a crucial challenge to all of us. -- <i>Cornel West, Alphonse Fletcher Jr. University Professor, Harvard University</i><br><br>Barbara Smith's new book, The Truth That Never Hurts: Writings on Race, Gender, and Freedom (Rutgers University Press) provides a universal message about struggle, resistance, and freedom, grounded within a black Lesbian feminist critique of America's culture and politics. The cogently written essays represent a cross-section of Smith's work over the past 20 years and the first book dedicated exclusively to her own writing. Focusing on race, feminism, and the politics of sexuality, Smith provides an alternative lens to view the world by making connections between systems of oppression and offering suggestions for social change. -- <i>THE WASHINGTON BLADE, Dec. 18, 1998</i><br><br>Barbara Smith's uncompromising intelligence helped invent the politics of intersection which grounds progressive thinking today. These essays deliver trenchant analysis from one of the most original, astute, and practical thinkers in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender movement. -- <i>Urvashi Vaid, director, The Policy Institute, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force</i><br><br>Sobering in what it has to tell us, The Truth That Never Hurts forces us to face those truths that disrupt the placid surfaces of our lives. A personal/political odyssey that documents some of the most critical moments in the last three decades of our national life, Smith's book forces us to new levels of awareness. Her piercing eye and uncompromising search for human justice for all make this volume must-reading for everyone who cares about the future. -- <i>Nellie Y. McKay, co-editor, The Norton Anthology of African American Literature</i><br><br>The ancestors are surely ecstatic about the diligence, courage, passion, and good humor exhibited in The Truth That Never Hurts. This is a landmark work from a pioneering activist who has always kept the faith. -- <i>Evelyn C. White, editor, The Black Women's Health Book</i></p><h2>One True God: Historical Consequences of Monotheism.</h2><p><p>Western history would be unrecognizable had it not been for people who believed in One True God. There would have been wars, but no religious wars. There would have been moral codes, but no Commandments. Had the Jews been polytheists, they would today be only another barely remembered people, less important, but just as extinct as the Babylonians. Had Christians presented Jesus to the Greco-Roman world as ''another'' God, their faith would long since have gone the way of Mithraism. And surely Islam would never have made it out of the desert had Muhammad not removed Allah from the context of Arab paganism and proclaimed him as the only God.</p><br><p> The three great monotheisms changed everything. With his customary clarity and vigor, Rodney Stark explains how and why monotheism has such immense power both to unite and to divide. Why and how did Jews, Christians, and Muslims missionize, and when and why did their efforts falter? Why did both Christianity and Islam suddenly become less tolerant of Jews late in the eleventh century, prompting outbursts of mass murder? Why were the Jewish massacres by Christians concentrated in the cities along the Rhine River, and why did the pogroms by Muslims take place mainly in Granada? How could the Jews persist so long as a minority faith, able to withstand intense pressures to convert? Why did they sometimes assimilate? In the final chapter, Stark also examines the American experience to show that it is possible for committed monotheists to sustain norms of civility toward one another.</p><br><p> A sweeping social history of religion, <i>One True God</i> shows how the great monotheisms shaped the past and created the modern world.</p></p><p><p>"I recommend this book with uncommon enthusiasm.

In <i>Auto Mania</i> he presents the first environmental history of the automobile that shows how consumer desire (and manufacturer decisions) created impacts across the product lifecycle from raw material extraction to manufacturing to consumer use to disposal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the provocative public antics of young millionaires who owned the first cars early in the twentieth century to the SUV craze of the 1990s, <i>Auto Mania</i> explores developments that touched the environment. Along the way McCarthy examines how Henry Ford&#x2019;s fetish for waste reduction tempered the environmental impacts of Model T mass production; how Elvis Presley&#x2019;s widely shared postwar desire for Cadillacs made matters worse; how the 1970s energy crisis hurt small cars; and why baby boomers ignored worries about global warming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>McCarthy shows that problems were recognized early. The difficulty was addressing them, a matter less of doing scientific research and educating the public than implementing solutions through America&#x2019;s market economy and democratic government. Consumer and producer interests have rarely aligned in helpful ways, and automakers and consumers have made powerful opponents of regulation. The result has been a mixed record of environmental reform with troubling prospects for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Tom McCarthy is associate professor, History Department, United States Naval Academy.</p>"McCarthy explores consumers' attachments to automobiles&#x2014;their sense of status in relation to the larger society&#x2014;that have had important repercussions for the environment."&#x2014;Sally H.

The emergent adult is seen at school, on the playing field, in his first job, and in front of his friends' families. Unfortunately, his parents usually see only the regressed child-moody and defiant-and, if they're not on the lookout, they'll miss seeing the more agreeable, increasingly adult thinker in their midst.With ingenious strategies for coaxing the more attractive of the two teen personalities into the home, family psychologist Mike Riera gives new hope to beleaguered and harried parents. From moving from a "managing" to a "consulting" role in a teen's life, from working with a teen's uniquely exasperating sleep rhythms to having real conversations when only monosyllables have been previously possible, <i>Staying Connected to Your Teenager</i> demonstrates ways to bring out the best in a teen-and, consequently, in an entire family.</p><p><b>Michael Riera, Ph.D.</b>, has worked in education since 1980.

Between those milestones were astounding highs and unfathomable lows. George Harrison's 1971 benefit for the suffering of Bangladesh showed the world the possibilities of rock's altruism, while Lennon asked the world to &#x201c;imagine&#x201d; universal peace before sitting out half the decade to raise his son. Ringo Starr, the most overlooked Beatle, carved himself a surprising niche in film before launching a string of hit singles. And Paul McCartney, widely seen as the instigator of the Fabs' breakup, became one of rock's most beloved performers, racking up record-breaking smashes that climaxed with a triumphant world tour in 1976.<br><br><i>Fab Four FAQ 2.0</i> picks up the story where the acclaimed <i>Fab Four FAQ</i> left off.

Spanning more than seven decades, from the turn of the century to the mid-seventies, <b>The Underpainter&#x2014;</b>in range, in the sheer power of its prose, and in its brilliant depiction of landscape and the geography of imagination&#x2014;is <b>Jane Urquhart</b>'s most accomplished novel to date, with one of the most powerful climaxes in contemporary fiction.</p><p>Jane Urquhart's <i>The Underpainter</i> is a very modern novel preoccupied with the power of the past. Austin Fraser, born in 1894, is a modernist who relentlessly paints over his canvases, much as he tries to eradicate people from his life. Though he insists that he has forgone emotion and love, when he receives news of a women he once knew, he can no longer stop memories from encroaching. <p> Urquhart's novel ranges from late-century Rochester, New York, to Ontario to Paris to New York City. And not since Patrick White's <i>The Vivisector</i> have there been such disturbing scenes of the painter in action: "I believed that I was drawing--literally drawing--everything out of her, that his act of making art filled the space around me so completely there would be no other impressions possible beyond the ones I controlled." Amazingly, by exposing Fraser's emptiness, Urquhart makes us pity him. Though she has said that she was "quite angry with Austin" while writing <i>The Underpainter</i>, the author's language incises his reluctant humanity and turns his life into a work of art.</p>&#x201c;Her language is pure, dazzling in its precision, like the etching of ice on glass.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A painterly masterwork&#x2026;poignant in each of its several landscapes and subtle in tracing the mingled nuances of love and pain.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Kirkus Reviews <br> <br>&#x201c;The detached eye of the narrator never falters, though passion hums beneath the surface like some vast primeval beast beneath the ice.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>The Independent</i> (U.K.) <br> <br>&#x201c;Writing with the eye of a painter, Urquhart transforms the energy of the world into enduring literature.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Kitchener-Waterloo Record</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Urquhart is one of Canada&#x2019;s most accomplished and interesting writers.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Edmonton Journal</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Original and dazzling, radiant and quietly perceptive, Urquhart&#x2019;s new novel delights the senses even as it astonishes the mind.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>London Free Press</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A lyrical novel with a deep, unsentimental connection to ordinary life&#x2026;[Urquhart&#x2019;s] language is vivid enough to take your breath away.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Boston Globe</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Urquhart explores the ability to love and the failure to love; the visual pictures and images of humanity beneath the surfaces on which art is created. <i>The Underpainter</i> is a savory read.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Flare</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Urquhart&#x2019;s evocation of time and place shimmers with clarity.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) <br> <br>&#x201c;Urquhart has written a novel whose narrative power matches her delicate artistry with words&#x2026;lodges in the mind and heart forever.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Montreal <i>Gazette</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Richly textured prose, and an intricate, many layered structure.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Sunday Times</i> (U.K.) <br> <br>&#x201c;A rich, multifaceted story, skillfully told.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br></p><h2>The Jews of Egypt: From Ramses II to Emperor Hadrian</h2><p>This is the story of the adventures and misadventures of the Jewish people in the land of Egypt.

So says best-selling author John Claypool. But with hopefulness comes the possibility of disappointment. How can we hope and yet be realistic about what we hope for? What is a hope that doesn&#x2019;t disappoint?</p> <p>In his inimitable pastoral and gentle way, Claypool explores biblically based avenues to hopefulness. Beginning with what we can and cannot know of God's promises, he discusses the value of humility in the face of the Great Mystery that is God. Claypool then examines what we can expect by letting God be God, and he looks at the place of forgiveness and second chances in seeking hope. His conclusion addresses the greatest hope, that of the life to come beyond the grave.</p> <p>This very personal book, written without theological jargon, will be a welcome companion to anyone who is struggling with disappointment, fear, or loss.</p></p><p>John Claypool is an Episcopal priest and a popular preacher, speaker, and retreat leader. He has written ten books and is the recipient of four honorary degrees. He currently teaches at Mercer University in Atlanta and divides his time between his residences in Atlanta and New Orleans."The Hopeful Heart is a sensitive and important book. John Claypool, world class preacher, steps out of the pulpit and leads us personally into the subterranean world of doubt and despair--where authentic hope is born. He points out that our expectations of what kind of help God will give us when we cry out to him often keep us from realizing when and how God is already helping us. God may send the miracle we pray for, but he may instead collaborate with us as we use our own creativity and strength, another miracle. But sometimes, when there is no miracle, no sense of solution or collaboration, God may give us the endurance to live in the problem, and experience real growth in the process (e.g. Paul's thorn in the flesh). But whatever God may send us, John helps us to recognize and receive the hope we long for. --Keith Miller<br><br>For fifty years now, John Claypool has devoted himself to the care of souls. In this small but focused book he offers the cumulative wisdom of those years to all whose hearts hunger for hope in a world that is running short on this ancient Christian virtue. --Barbara Taylor, author of When God Is Silent<br><br>When you get a chance to hear John Claypool preach, you go. And when you get a chance to sit with him, you sit. Decades of pastoral and personal experience have combined to teach this renowned pastor a lot about what hope is and what it isn't, and have given him the wisdom to share it with us in simplicity and grace. --Barbara Crafton</p><h2>A Question of Time</h2><p>Private eye Joe Keogh and his mysterious companion, the quietly malevolent Mr. Strangeways, search across time and in the Grand Canyon for a missing woman. By the author of Books of Lost Swords.</p><p><b>Fred Saberhagen</b> (1930-2007) is the author of the popular Berserker (tm) Series, the Dracula series and the bestselling <i>Lost Swords </i>and <i>Book of Lost Swords</i>.Dark fantasy about a deformity in time in the Grand Canyon, by the author of the Berserker and Lost Swords series, etc. Saberhagen begins his time-warp tale by anchoring it solidly in gritty 1935, with down-and-outer Jake Rezner coming across a young woman artist in the Grand Canyon with whom he falls into an affair. It happens that Camilla's the bait for her master, Edgar Tyrrell, a sculptor who is now among the nosferatu, or vampires. Tyrannous Tyrrell has kept Camilla wrapped in a time warp--in which he has a mine from which he digs strange little white nodules. He- -or his divorced wife Sarah--is selling his sculpture piecemeal in the 1990's, now that he's a famous ``dead'' eccentric. Jake finds himself in bondage to Tyrrell, who is building himself a psychic empire based on the time warp. Meanwhile, in 1991, aged Sarah hires the Keogh psychic detective agency to recover her missing grandniece, Cathy, who is lost in the Canyon. Bill Burdon, who works for Keogh, himself gets lost in the Canyon and runs across Cathy, who's camping out in a geologic time-fault in One Million B.C. Bill makes Polaroids of her when she refuses to return with him. Then, trying to find a way out, he discovers the famous Tyrrell house--in 1935!--in which live young Sarah and little Cathy. Later, he shows the aged Sarah pictures of herself and Cathy he's taken in 1935--as well as shots of Cathy in a much earlier period. How will Jake and Camilla, in the Canyon of saber-toothed tigers and strange bears, escape from deathproof Tyrrell, who sleeps days in an impregnable cave and sups on Camilla's neck on various evenings? Will Cathy be brought out of the Miocene? Time in a spaghetti tangle. Starts well, ends comic-strippy. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now in the same devastatingly beautiful language that has won her critical and popular acclaim, Melinda Haynes returns to the country she knows so well -- the backwoods South of the 1960s -- to tell the story of a mysterious town and its inhabitants, each with their own afflictions and joys, each with their own secrets.</p><p>In sparsely populated George County, Mississippi, along a quiet dirt road lined by sharecropper houses, lies Chalktown -- a small village of folks who communicate mostly through the chalkboards hanging from their front porches. Down the road lives the Sheehand family: 16-year-old Hezekiah, his reckless sister Arena, his mentally disabled younger brother Yellababy, and their disaffected and often cruel mother, Susan Blair, whose husband has abandoned both the house and the family. One day, with Yellababy strapped to his back, Hez sets out for Chalktown, determined to plumb its mysteries, or maybe just to get away from his shabby home's oppressive atmosphere. And, on that same spring day, the family he's left behind will confront a tragedy that at once erases Hez's bitter past and paves the way for a hopeful future. Armed with a gothic and spiritual sensibility reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor, Melinda Haynes weaves her characters' lives and stories into an unforgettable tapestry of sorrow and salvation that confirms her place as one of our country's most exciting and consistently brilliant new writers.</p></p><p>The lifeline of Melinda Haynes's novel <i>Chalktown</i> is a rutted, meandering dirt road that winds its way past the murky waterways and through the one-shop towns and backwoods of George County, Mississippi. It's also a red flag to anyone looking for a good dose of surreal Southern gothic. Here is the isolated shack of a disintegrating white-trash family, there the village dwellers who communicate solely by writing notes on the chalkboards in their front yards. One character is grotesquely scarred by an adult bout with chicken pox, while others are eaten up by less identifiable diseases and appetites. Dreams are pursued, discarded, and eerily enacted, always in the sort of luscious, graphic prose you would expect from the author of <i>Mother of Pearl</i>. <p> Perhaps the term <i>family</i> is a misnomer for the Sheehands, a bunch of misfits drawn together by impulse and wrenched apart by hope, desire, and murder. Fairy, the philandering father camped out in an old school bus, can't extricate himself from the burden of "women and their sticky flaws." His wife, Susan-Blair, is slowly burying herself beneath other people's possessions in her makeshift consignment store, even as she neglects her children and chats it up with the ever-present Christ of her Pentecostal upbringing. No wonder 16-year-old Hezekiah sets off down the road to Chalktown in the opening pages of the novel, carrying his disabled brother in a backpack. His encounters along the way make for a Robert Altman-like series of takes on the bizarre nature of reality in George County. </p><p> The literary landscape of the Deep South is, of course, teeming with eccentric characters. Yet Haynes's are so fleshed-out that the reader is left feeling almost crowded, like (to quote Susan-Blair) a "durn closet full a somebody else's coats. Coats put there by people who went on to someplace else, some other thing." The author is no less gifted at conveying a sense of place. She uses the colorful brushstrokes of a painter--which she also happens to be--to imbue this story with a dark, sultry, and unmistakably Southern feel. The result is a captivating, consuming read. <i>--S.

The plan was to offer a more manageable, less expensive model than the mighty 7-litre Silver Ghost, one intended for the owner-driver rather than for the chauffeur, yet with all the quality and refinement of the bigger cars. The Twenty and its succeeding models was a success. All these models enjoy a very strong following today. More than 10,000 were made, and many survive today.

One of the "customs" of the time was for the conquerors to take members of the subdued country's nobility as hostages. When 14-year-old Hugh O'Donnell is tricked by an English wine merchant into boarding his ship, he and his two friends are imprisoned and taken to Dublin where they are held captive in Dublin Castle. They are fed well, allowed regular visits from their families, and allowed to exercise within the castle walls. Of course, they are kept against their will, and therein lies the rub. More than once, the three attempt escape, and more than once one or all of them are caught. Hugh finally succeeds on his fourth attempt, at the age of 18. However, his feet are badly frostbitten, and he is crippled for the remainder of his life. The story starts slowly, but rapidly turns into an exciting tale. Other than Hugh, most of the characters are one-dimensional, even his fellow prisoners. Lisson uses a lot of Irish Gaelic terminology, and although a pronunciation guide is included at the end of the book, there is no glossary. While more detail-oriented readers will find it extremely frustrating not to know the meanings of words that seem to be key to the story, others will just enjoy the fast-paced adventure.<p></p><p><i>Marlyn K.

Regardless of their size or shape, their forms follow their functions. They are honest. They are beautiful. And they are rapidly vanishing. Across the land we see abandoned farms with barns falling down, being torn down, and only occasionally being converted to other uses. As urban sprawl eats up the countryside and food-producing Goliaths put small farmers out of business, the need for old barns has diminished. For most of his life as a photographer, David Plowden has admired and photographed barns. In recent years, as their disappearance accelerated, he made it his mission to document these beautiful structures, before they too are lost. The result is this beautiful book, his hymn to the American barn. 130 duotone photographs</p><p><p><strong>David Plowden</strong> is the author of more than twenty photography books, including <em>Bridges: The Spans of North America</em>, <em>Vanishing Point: Fifty Years of Photography</em>, and <em>Requiem for Steam</em>. He lives in Winnetka, Illinois.</p><p><strong>David Plowden</strong> is the author of more than twenty photography books, including <em>Bridges: The Spans of North America</em>, <em>Vanishing Point: Fifty Years of Photography</em>, and <em>Requiem for Steam</em>. He lives in Winnetka, Illinois.</p>For once, an album of Plowden's superb black-and-white photographs is classified as an art book rather than, because he photographs functional buildings and machines, a technology tome. And perhaps no other Plowden book is as obviously artistic as this display of dairy barns in the northeastern U.S and southeast Canada. The vast planes of barn walls, doors, and roofs, usually set upon vast planes of prairie and against vast planes of sky, inevitably suggest, to art cognoscenti, the formal concerns of cubism and its American realist cognate, precisionism, especially since the latter was developed by painters <i>and </i>photographers. Yes, these pictures look like Charles Sheeler's paintings and photos, but it is doubtful that Plowden had those precedents in mind. His lovely prefatory memoir never mentions other art, and in the acknowledgments, he calls the book "more of a poem . . . an elegy." That is, it fits with the rest of his work, which affectionately, respectfully records a world of work that is vanishing from North America. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It starts with the creation of the universe, after which God created the human pair from whom all peoples of the world have come. Genesis provides insights as to how sin came into the world, under what circumstances the people of Israel became God's covenant people, and how Israel's God is not simply a local deity or tribal god.</p> <p>Throughout the book of Genesis, we learn that God wanted the people created in His image to know about Him. He demonstrates His desire for fellowship with humankind. He met people where they were and drew them toward himself, no matter how far humans strayed from God's plan. God also showed that He could not make a treaty with sin and that sin carries a punishment with it. God also proved He is a covenant God, one who gives and keeps His word.</p> <p>Author Wilbur Williams brings scholarly support as well as archeological support to the validity of the biblical record. Dr. Williams shares his enthusiasm for the way that archeological discoveries verify the details of Genesis. As he presents the story of God and humanity from the book of Genesis, we are able to understand a bit more about God and ourselves.</p> <p>An excellent resource for personal study, and especially helpful for those involved in the teaching ministries of the church, the Wesleyan Bible Study Commentary series will encourage and promote life change in believers by applying God's authoritative truth in relevant, practical ways.

Of the thousands that have taken the course, all have taken on a semester project of some type. Most have chosen to write an appraisal paper on &#34;What I thought about the Old Testament, and what I now think about it.&#34; For this assignment, they have been expected to write the first half at the beginning of their study and the remainder a week before the end of the course. Most of the papers have begun something like this: &#34;I set my mind to read the entire New Testament, but I soon got bogged down with all the geneologies of Genesis 10 and 11. I gave up the project, going back to the New Testament. Some students testified that they made it through Genesis, but could not get past the antiquated laws and ordinances beginning in Exodus 21, followed by all the tedious descriptions of the Tabernacle and its fittings and furniture. Admittedly, casual readers struggle to read the Old Testament and find connections between all its books. Casual readers do not quite grasp why a prophet wrote what he did, since they do not know how to connect those writings to historical information given in the books of Kings and Chronicles. Even when reading Genesis, people cannot understand why God would allow His people to participate in what appear to be pagan practices by people of faith. To make the Old Testament a more approachable book has been part of my lifelong quest. But of all the Old Testament books, the most difficult book to grasp fully in significant ways has been the book of Genesis. Why? First, there are great differences between the cultural practices of the times of the patriarchs and those of our time. Those differences involve multiple wives (29:21-30), marriage to close relatives (20:12), favoritism within the family causing deception and rivalry (25:28; 27:2-40), servitude that bordered on slavery (29:24, 29), and the almost absolute exploitation of women (19:8). Second, Genesis is a book that compressed the most amount of time in its coverage. And great gaps of time exist between chapters and verses. For example, thirteen years transpire between the events of chapters 16 and 17. Twenty years occur between verses 20 and 26 of chapter 25. Hundreds of years pass between the end of Genesis and the beginning of Exodus. But the greatest span of time is encompassed in the first eleven chapters, chronicling the period from the Creation to the life of Abraham. Unfortunately for us, God did not reveal definitively the amount of time involved in this period. God gave only a skeletal outline of the world&#39;s history to the time of the patriarchs. From there, relatively speaking, He allowed events to slow to a crawl so all could see how He worked to make salvation possible for all the world. In graduate school, I chose to study under Jewish professors. I hoped that these descendents of those to whom God chose to give the truth could help me glean additional nuances of meaning from Hebrew thought and expression. I am grateful for their teaching. I hope some of what I learned comes through to the reader of this book. I have not attempted to be overly technical but have sought to clarify the depth of meaning in and behind the text. I have tried to discover the heart of God as He expresses it in the pages of Genesis. He patiently worked with people prone to influence from pagan customs, those who gave in to the pull of sin, those who repeatedly moved away from Him. With undying love and faithful leadership, God worked so steadily to bring Abraham to a level of faith that could be reckoned to him as righteousness (15:6). God enabled Isaac to live a sufficiently peaceful life through the unfaltering obedience of Abraham (25:11). Jacob, ever more crafty and more prone to deception, finally quit trying to manipulate others when, in anticipation of meeting Esau, he met the Lord instead. God changed his grasping inner nature. I prayerfully hope that readers of this commentary will also meet the Lord and be changed by the experience. In appreciation for assistance in the composition of this book, my deepest gratitude goes to Dr. Phil Bence, who often challenged my assumptions, gave invaluable advice, made constructive suggestions, and helped me to give a more cohesive presentation of the truth. My gratitude also goes to Darlene Teague and Kelly Trennepohl, who unfailingly read the manuscript with patient, word-by-word scrutiny to improve expressions and keep verb tesnse uniform, thereby greatly improving the readability of the book. Above all, though, no small part of this work has come from God&#39;s help in the thoughts, ideas, and expressins that have been prayerfully inserted. I pray you approve; more yet, I pray He approves. Wilbur G.

The starting point for the book is the Vitra Design Museum&#x2019;s extensive, never before seen lighting collection, from which particularly rare and important pieces are reproduced here&#x2015;by designers such as Charlotte Perriand, Le Corbusier, Achille Castiglioni and Gino Sarfatti. Parallel to these works, contemporary examples from the fields of design and art explore the current developments and transitions in light design: from new illumination concepts and innovative light designs to dynamic urban street lighting and energy efficient multifunctional (media) facades up to art installations and light experiments. <i>Lightopia</i> looks at natural phenomena and new technologies as well as exploring the fundamental emotional power of light. The spectrum of works surveyed extends from light objects inter alia by Troika and Mischer Traxler up to installations by Olafur Eliasson. These art and design objects are juxtaposed with exhibits from different cultural-historical contexts, which all allude to light&#x2019;s various symbolic connotations and speak of people&#x2019;s ongoing fascination with light throughout the ages.</p><p></p><h2>After Midnight</h2><p>While house-sitting for her friend, Alice, using an old Civil War saber, descends into a world of murder and madness when her mind begins playing tricks on her and paranoia sets in. Original.</p><p>Richard Laymon was born in Chicago in 1947 and grew up in California. Four of his books have been shortlisted for the Bram Stoker Award, which he won in 2001 with THE TRAVELLING VAMPIRE SHOW. Among his many acclaimed works of horror and suspense are THE STAKE, SAVAGE, AFTER MIDNIGHT and the four novels in the Beast House Chronicles: THE CELLAR, THE BEAST HOUSE, THE MIDNIGHT TOUR and FRIDAY NIGHT IN BEAST HOUSE. He died in February 2001.Although Laymon died in 2001, his U.K. novels have only recently gotten an American release; this 1997 title is a sordid, flawed gem, both stomach churning and erotic, and not infrequently at the same time. Narrated by paranoid, defiant 26-year-old Alice, the book opens on a peaceful night of house-sitting&#x2014;but as Alice warns, "You can <i>never</i> be sure it's safe." Indeed, shortly after midnight she spots a strange man emerge from the woods and go swimming naked in the family pool. A fortunately timed phone call that's a wrong number gives Alice the chance to drive off the stranger, but sets in motion a 24-hour whirlwind of murder, terror and madness, beginning when Alice splits open someone's head with a Civil War saber&#x2014;and escalating precipitously from there. Alice's matter-of-fact attitude toward her grisly handiwork can make her hard to sympathize with ("I felt rotten about killing him, but not particularly guilty"); supporting characters are easier to like, but don't get too attached. As the night wears on, Laymon piles on gory details and violent sex with perverse, over-the-top glee; it's definitely not for everyone and can strain credibility, but Alice proves to be one of Laymon's most original and memorable protagonists, and should keep hardened horror fans reading well past the stroke of midnight. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

My name is Tammy Gold, and today is the day that finding the perfect nanny for your family just got easier. Whether you&#x2019;re a first-time parent or a mother of five, whether you work seventy hours a week or twenty, hiring someone to help you care for your most precious possession&#x2014;your child&#x2014;can be an incredibly daunting task. The good news is that it no longer has to be. You&#x2019;ve picked up this book, and I&#x2019;m here to help. </p><p>In many ways, my life has always been about helping parents and their children. After college, I received my master&#x2019;s degree in social work from Columbia University and began working as a therapist for at-risk children in a New Jersey school. It was while working with these kids&#x2014;many of whom suffered from neglect and abuse&#x2014;that I witnessed firsthand the effects that poor caregiving could have on a child and the critical link between healthy, effective parenting and a child&#x2019;s social, emotional, and intellectual development.</p><p>As a student at Columbia, I had been very interested in attachment theory, which is the science of how early caregiving influences a child&#x2019;s life. First developed by the British psychiatrist John Bowlby, attachment theory asserts that for an infant&#x2019;s social and emotional development to occur normally, the child needs to form a close, trusting relationship with at least one primary caregiver during infancy and the earliest years of life. Other well-known theorists such as Mary Ainsworth and Erik Erikson confirmed Bowlby&#x2019;s research with a number of landmark studies that showed conclusively that the earliest bonds formed by children with their caregivers have a tremendous impact. A mother who is available and responsive to an infant&#x2019;s needs establishes a sense of security and creates what Ainsworth called a &#x201c;secure base&#x201d; for the child to then explore the world. Erikson argued that a child&#x2019;s entire identity is shaped by an early sense of &#x201c;trust vs. mistrust,&#x201d; depending on whether his caregivers reliably respond to his needs and provide constant care and affection. In short, infants and very young children <i>need</i> to establish strong relationships with loving, devoted caregivers in order to grow up to be emotionally healthy, happy, stable adults.</p><p>It was also around this time that I gave birth to our first daughter, Braydin. After years of dreaming about having my own children, motherhood didn&#x2019;t turn out to be as easy or straightforward as I&#x2019;d expected. Braydin was extremely colicky, so instead of sharing all of these beautiful Pampers moments with my new baby, she cried constantly, and I was a wreck. The pediatrician had no answers, and I just kept thinking to myself, &#x201c;How is it possible that I had no preparation for this?&#x201d; I was exhausted and overwhelmed, and worst of all, I felt like I was failing as a parent. Here I was, a childhood therapist, and I had no idea how to help my own child!</p><p>Eventually, through my own research, I figured out that Braydin had reflux, and once I switched her to a hypoallergenic formula, she was a new baby. But the experience made me realize that all parents occasionally need help to be the best caregivers they can be&#x2014;even those, like myself, who have experience with children. When my maternity leave ended, I decided to start my own business devoted to giving moms and dads the support and tools they need to be better parents, particularly in the early, developmentally crucial years of a child&#x2019;s life. Because I had studied attachment theory and child development, I knew that there was, in fact, an essential formula for raising happy, well-adjusted children. I wanted to share this information with other parents, so I started taking on clients and the business grew.</p><p>But then something unexpected started to happen. I was working from home and had hired a nanny, Maria, to care for Braydin while I was with my clients. After those first rough months with a colicky baby, Maria was a godsend. She was warm and lively and full of energy, always willing to jump in and do whatever was needed. She was fantastic with Braydin, always singing and playing and loving, and she was a huge support for me as well while I learned to juggle motherhood and my career. Even my friends noticed that Maria was providing our family with a whole different level of childcare, and they started asking me, &#x201c;How did you find your nanny? I&#x2019;ve never seen a nanny like that before.&#x201d; Or saying, &#x201c;I wish I had a relationship with my nanny like the one you have with Maria,&#x201d; because they saw that there was no tension or drama. Before long, they approached me to ask for help, saying, &#x201c;I know this isn&#x2019;t exactly what you do, but what we really need more than anything is a good nanny. Can you help us find someone like Maria?&#x201d;</p><p>So I started helping my friends find their nannies, and I quickly learned that I approached the nanny-search process very differently from other parents. Most of them treated it like hiring a babysitter, and if the nanny could answer basic questions and had good references, they made an offer. But when I had hired Maria, I had instinctively employed all my skills as a social worker and therapist&#x2014;that is, the ability to read people and assess their character and personality, as well as perform a candid self-assessment&#x2014;to help me figure out the right fit for our family. I had used my knowledge of child development theory to think about what Braydin needed most at the time, and when I met with nanny candidates, my therapist training allowed me to pick up on subtle cues and spot red flags that most people didn&#x2019;t see. I also realized that my relationship with Maria had directly benefited from my experience as a therapist working with both individuals and couples; by using proper communication techniques, I had been able to foster an extremely positive working relationship between us while at the same time motivating her to perform at a high level. Soon, in addition to helping my friends find great caregivers, I was being invited into their homes to help them communicate more effectively with their nannies and mend broken nanny&#x2013;family relationships. I found myself on the front lines of the nanny&#x2013;parent experience, gaining unique insights and information, and learning how to make the relationship work for both parties at every stage.</p><p>I also realized that the best childcare situations were defined by what I call Constancy of Care&#x2014;that is, a marked continuity in terms of quality and style of care across <i>all</i> caregivers who are responsible for the child: mother, father, and nanny, as well as any babysitters or daycare workers. If the nanny was able to mirror the parents in terms of attentiveness and parenting approach, the child was always calm and happy, even when the parents left, because she never experienced a drop in the level of care or affection. By finding a nanny who was able to parent &#x201c;like Mom,&#x201d; or teaching the current nanny to mimic the parents&#x2019; caregiving style, mothers and fathers could be apart from their children while still creating the stability and close, consistent emotional bonds promoted by attachment theory. Helping parents achieve their own particular version of Constancy of Care, both during and after the hiring process, became a key part of my Gold Standard approach.</p><p>As time went on, and the word of mouth spread, my friends started calling me the &#x201c;Nanny Whisperer,&#x201d; and I decided to offer nanny&#x2013;family matching and mediation as official services through my business. My first paying client was a new mom, Natalie, who worked in Manhattan and was about to leave her six-week-old daughter to go back to work. And it was through helping her that I truly understood just how life-changing these services could be. Here was this new mother, so vulnerable and overwhelmed and terrified of leaving her child. But when together we found her a wonderful caregiver, it made all the difference. She felt so much better about herself as a mom and about the life choices she had made because she was confident that her daughter would be getting the very best possible care while she was gone.</p><p>How to Use This Book</p><p>Whether you are about to hire a nanny for the very first time, or you currently employ a nanny, this book can help you improve your experience and achieve the Gold Standard of care for your child. Part 1 explains my approach and why the right family&#x2013;nanny match is so important. It also introduces you to my unique way of thinking about nannies and childcare, so that you can truly understand what a nanny is and does and what you should expect from the relationship. It also explores the common myths and misconceptions about nannies that create problems between parents and their child&#x2019;s caregiver. Part 2 presents my Gold Standard hiring process, which is designed to help you find your ideal nanny and includes my one-of-a-kind Family Needs Assessment as well as breakthrough approaches to screening, reference checks, interviews, and doing in-home trials.</p><p>Part 3 is all about managing the relationship with your nanny and resolving any issues or conflicts that may arise. If you already have a nanny but aren&#x2019;t completely satisfied and aren&#x2019;t sure whether you should stick with your current caregiver or start fresh, Part 3 is designed to help you bring out the best in your nanny and know which issues are fixable and which are a sign that it&#x2019;s time to move on. Every child deserves the Gold Standard of care, and you have everything you need in these pages to achieve that exceptional standard of care in your own home.</p><p>In the years since I became the Nanny Whisperer, I have learned that what I do to help families is incredibly important. When I place a great nanny or mend an existing nanny&#x2013;parent relationship, something magical happens. I&#x2019;ve helped the mom be a better mother because she now has a true partner&#x2014;she can be &#x201c;on&#x201d; with her children and then leave for work or go recharge at the gym or have coffee with friends, knowing that her child is in great hands. I&#x2019;ve helped the dad because he can pursue his job with peace of mind, and I&#x2019;ve helped their marriage by giving them both more time and energy to devote to each other. And I&#x2019;ve helped the children the most because they&#x2019;re being cared for not just by capable parents but by an extra capable adult as well&#x2014;and everyone&#x2019;s happy! Happy parents and a happy caregiver make for a double-happy child.</p><p>So how do we get you and your family to this happy place? Let&#x2019;s get started.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Nanny Whisperer 101</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>How (and How Not) to Achieve the Gold Standard of Care</p><p>One afternoon at one of my &#x201c;Nanny Know-How&#x201d; events in New York City, a young woman stood up and introduced herself to the group.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, my name is Karen,&#x201d; she began. &#x201c;And I just wanted to say that I am the poster child for how not to go about finding a nanny. </p><p>&#x201c;Our daughter is six months old, and we started looking for a nanny, which was our first choice for childcare, several months ago. We thought we had plenty of time before I had to go back to work, but now I&#x2019;m actually starting back at work next week, and our daughter is going to daycare because we never found the right person. We went about our search in completely the wrong way; we didn&#x2019;t really know what we wanted, so we just started bringing people in and talking to them, thinking that we&#x2019;d have an emotional connection with someone and that would mean everything else was right. We didn&#x2019;t understand how uncomfortable talking about money would be, so we met with a ton of nannies without really discussing salary, and then when we finally found someone we liked, she said she wanted to be paid &#x2018;off the books.&#x2019; We wanted to do &#x2018;on the books,&#x2019; so after all that legwork, we couldn&#x2019;t agree on salary and the nanny took another job. </p><p>&#x201c;Now our daughter is starting daycare and I have to do the nanny search all over again. I&#x2019;m here because, this time, I want to do it right.&#x201d;</p><p>I immediately understood Karen&#x2019;s experience, because it is typical of the way that most parents choose nannies: They feel their way through this most important process without a plan, and with only their gut instincts to guide them. But finding a nanny is no small task, and more parents face this challenge today than ever before. Whether you are East Coast or West Coast, urban or suburban, chances are that many of the parents that you know rely on some form of regular childcare. The number of families with two working parents continues to grow, and even moms and dads who chose to be at home or at home part-time often require an extra set of hands to keep up with the pace and demands of modern parenthood. In fact, statistics show that 50 percent of all U.S. children are in some type of formal childcare arrangement by the time they are nine months old. Finding the right person (or persons) to care for your child when you are not there has become every bit as essential as potty training and teaching the ABCs.</p><p>Yet while there are hundreds of resources available to tell you how to puree your own organic baby food or sleep train your toddler, there are almost none that teach moms and dads the right way to go about finding a nanny, or how to work with that nanny effectively. Many of my clients come to me as first-time parents because they are completely daunted by the nanny-search process&#x2014;where to find a nanny, what to expect, and how much to pay&#x2014;but I also get clients who, despite the best of intentions, have been through five nannies in two years and have no idea what they&#x2019;re doing wrong. Most parents rely on advice from friends when conducting their search, but without a proven system or strategy to guide them, they end up making mistakes that set the stage for future problems: They prioritize the wrong qualifications, ask the wrong questions, and fail to zero in on what they, as a family, truly need. It doesn&#x2019;t help that the nanny world is like the Wild West, completely unregulated and often under the table; there are no rules, there is no standardized training or hiring protocol, and there is no board or government agency to provide professional oversight. Anyone can advertise themselves as a nanny, and yet I have found that many parents do more due diligence when buying a car than they do when hiring their child&#x2019;s caregiver. </p><p>Unfortunately, the stakes are higher than they realize. Science tells us that 90 percent of the human brain develops by age three, so any person who cares for your child during these formative years&#x2014;be it a nanny, a babysitter, or a daycare worker&#x2014;will without question shape your child&#x2019;s personality. Young children, especially infants and toddlers, learn from their caregivers every minute of every day, which means that everything about your nanny&#x2014;her demeanor, her physicality, and whether or not she will actively teach and engage your child&#x2014;will have a direct impact on his or her social, emotional, and intellectual development. If the chemistry between the nanny and child isn&#x2019;t right, if the nanny is bored or checked out, if there is high nanny turnover, or if the nanny&#x2013;parent relationship is strained, there can be real and lasting consequences for the child. Especially during the early years, the difference between an exceptional caregiver and a mediocre one can be enormous....</p></p><h2>Behind the Crimson Blind</h2><p>World-famous supersleuth Sir Henry Merrivale&#39;s visit to Tangier is supposed to be a vacation, but with the brazen international thief known as &#34;Iron Chest&#34; also in town, Sir Henry cannot resist flexing his crook-catching muscle</p><p></p><h2>The Chinese century: a photographic history</h2><p>The Chinese century: a photographic history</p><p></p><h2>Night Sky (National Audubon Society First Field Guide)</h2><p>A field guide to the night sky, explaining through text and maps how to locate and identify stars, planets, meteors, comets, and constellations</p><p></p><h2>A Question of Identity: A Simon Serrailler Mystery (Chief Superintendent Simon Serrailler Mystery)</h2><p>A particularly unpleasant murder, that of a very old woman in a housing project, rocks the town of Lafferton.

As per Psalm 83, destiny&#x2019;s design for this great army is a head to head confrontation with a formidable Arab confederacy consisting of Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Jordanians, Saudi Arabians and Egyptians. This Arab coalition has been developing in its fledgling stages since 1948 and will climax and officially confederate in the very near future. The Israeli Defense Force will decisively defeat this offensive and prove to be the &#x201c;exceedingly great army&#x201d; of Ezekiel 37:10. They will expand their territory, become regionally superior, take prisoners of war and exploit the resources of these conquered Arab nations. In that condition they will become one of, if not the wealthiest nations on earth. It is from that position of empowerment that the Jews will dwell securely in the Middle East. Subsequently the world stage is set for the Russian &#x2013; Iranian led coalition of nations, which will form against Israel as prophesied in the book of Ezekiel, chapters 38 and 39. This non&#x2013;fiction thriller is carefully designed to cautiously navigate the reader through the end time&#x2019;s calendar.</p><p>Bill is the up and coming talent, whose author styling appeals to scholars and laymen alike. His new book called ISRALESTINE; The Ancient Blueprints of the Future Middle East, takes an exhaustive, but adventurous look at unfulfilled Bible prophecies intended for today&#x2019;s international audience. Bill Salus is an expert at explaining the prophetic relevance of current Middle East and world events. Readers appreciate his unique insights and sensible, rather than sensational approach to understanding the Bible. He allows prophecy to speak for itself, rather than modernizing it into newspaper exegesis. Shortly after becoming a Christian in 1992, writing became a daily discipline for Bill. He began with devotional pieces but soon realized that he was prophetically inclined. After the events of September 11, 2001, along with the encouragement of Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum the founder of Ariel Ministries, Bill embarked upon a tireless path of discerning prophecies that apply today. It has become Bill&#x2019;s personal challenge to demonstrate the love of God through prophecy to each reader. As he composes one page upon another, it becomes clear to the spectator that prophecy is a spectacular gift from a God who cares for the entirety of humanity. The discovery of prophecy as a gift rather than a threat is what most characterizes Bill&#x2019;s work. People all over the world are learning through his steadfast efforts, that prophecy is not just for the scholarly but also for every common man, woman and child. Whether writing, teaching, doing interviews or speaking in front of large and diverse audiences, Bill guarantees to impart understandable information.

Now, in an inspirational and entertaining rebuttal, the legendary basketball coach Bob Knight explains why &#x201c;negative thinking&#x201d; will actually produce more positive results, in sports and in daily life. Coach Knight, the second-winningest coach in NCAA history with 902 victories, explains that victory is often attained by the team that makes the fewest mistakes. His coaching philosophy was to instill discipline by &#x201c;preparing to win&#x201d; rather than hoping to win. That meant understanding the downside and drilling his teams to prevent the things that could go wrong. And when his teams did win, he made sure they didn&#x2019;t dwell on their success, but rather looked immediately to the challenges of the next game. He applies this lesson to business strategy as well.<p></p> <p>Coach Knight has long been inspired by his grandmother&#x2019;s words, "If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.&#x201d; As the first person to teach Knight about the power of negative thinking, this book is dedicated to her pragmatic spirit.</p></p><p>Bob Knight compiled one of the greatest records ever in college basketball: 5 National Coach of the Year awards, 3 NCAA championships, 11 Big Ten championships, an Olympics championship, and 902 victories overall, along with achieving a near-perfect graduation rate for his players. Knight is also a featured commentator for ESPN&#x2019;s college basketball coverage, on camera at least once a week. His first book, <i>Knight: My Story</i>, spent five weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list. Bob Hammel is the coauthor of both books.Knight&#x2019;s success as a college basketball coach is unquestioned. He was college basketball&#x2019;s Coach of the Year five times and won three NCAA championships. He&#x2019;s currently a basketball analyst for ESPN. Knight&#x2019;s success was built on preparation. Recognizing that offensive success could be fleeting, he always emphasized defense, which he describes as making the appropriate response to the negativity one can encounter on offense. So negative thinking about offense leads one to focus, as coaches and players, on defense. See? It&#x2019;s a conceit that lends itself more to a catchy title than an application in sports, life, or business. What we&#x2019;re really left with here is solid, commonsensical advice on preparation&#x2014;how to move quickly from one success to the next challenge rather than basking in the afterglow, as well as how to use losses (failures) as inspiration while moving through life. Knight sprinkles personal anecdotes throughout to illustrate his points and concludes each chapter with a couple aphorisms he calls &#x201c;Knight&#x2019;s Nuggets.&#x201d; (For example: &#x201c;One more beer can&#x2019;t hurt . . . unless you&#x2019;re driving.&#x201d;) This is an easily digestible self-help book by a very successful man. The advice is generally useful, except for the Nuggets. Hold the Nuggets, next time, Mr. Knight. There&#x2019;s a negative you can build on. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>Indigo Dying (China Bayles Mystery)</h2><p>In the small town of Indigo, Texas, to teach a workshop, herbalist China Bayles is determined to help the dying town back to life, until she and her best friend Ruby become embroiled in the investigation into the murder of longtime resident Casey Ford, whose plans to sell his profitable mining rights would have destroyed the town forever. By the author of Bloodroot.</p><p><b>Susan Wittig Albert</b> grew up on a farm in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. A former professor of English and a university administrator and vice president, she is the author of the China Bayles Mysteries, the Darling Dahlias Mysteries, and the Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter. Some of her recent titles include<i> Widow&#x2019;s Tears</i>,<i> Cat&#x2019;s Claw</i>,<i> </i><i>The Darling Dahlias and the Confederate Rose</i>, and <i>The Tale of Castle Cottage</i>. She and her husband, Bill, coauthor a series of Victorian-Edwardian mysteries under the name Robin Paige, which includes such titles as <i>Death at Glamis Castle </i>and <i>Death at Whitechapel</i>.This latest accomplished entry in Albert's detective series featuring defense attorney-cum-herbalist China Bayles is both a smalltown murder mystery and a portrait of a Texas community whose existence is threatened by a dispute over mining rights. Bayles, who was also featured in Albert's Bloodroot and Mistletoe Man, has recently become part-owner of a combination herb shop and tea house called Thyme for Tea in tiny Indigo, Tex. But her new life-and the lifestyle of the bohemian entrepreneurs and elderly Indigo natives in the community-is put in jeopardy when Casey Ford, a reviled but powerful Indigo resident, concocts a plan to sell the coal-mining rights to a national conglomerate, a scheme that would allow him to evict most of the store owners in town once the deal is done. Ford is murdered days before he signs the agreement. Bayles and her husband, another former attorney named Mike McQuaid, find themselves stymied in their investigation of the murder by a town full of suspects who close ranks as they celebrate Ford's sudden death. Albert does a nice job of placing believable red herrings in Bayles's way, and she adds colorful details about herbal medicine and the dye business (another of Bayles's specialties). The heart of the book is the detailed depiction of smalltown life in Indigo, which separates the novel from genre fodder by providing a rich context for the mystery. The satisfying ending is icing on the cake, and Albert's impressions of Indigo are likely to stay in readers' minds long after the murder has faded.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Unwritten Books</h2><p>A forefront literary critic meditates on seven books he had intended to write, explaining that his unwritten works proved too intimate, challenging, or painful to commit to publication and revealing how the stories confronted such themes as aberrant sex, exile, and the humbling limitations of talent.</p><p>George Steiner's splendid <i>My Unwritten Books</i> suggests we need a pro-life movement in the publishing world&#x2014;now.Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College at Cambridge University and the author of dozens of books (The Death of Tragedy, After Babel, Martin Heidegger, In Bluebeard&#x2019;s Castle), George Steiner is one of the world&#x2019;s foremost intellectuals.</p><h2>Secrets of the Great Golf Course Architects: A Treasury of the World&#39;s Greatest Golf Courses by History&#39;s Master Designers</h2><p>The tests a golfer faces on the course are the direct result of the challenges originally faced by the golf course architect, whether they be complicated terrain, forces of nature, budget limitations, demanding developers, or the difficult task of balancing the practical scientific needs of a golf course with the architect&#x2019;s creative instincts.<br><br>Secrets of the Great Golf Course Architects offers readers behind-the-scenes tales from America&#x2019;s master architects themselves in their own words.

Shiels resides in Michigan, where he hosts an award-winning syndicated morning radio program.&#x201c; <p>You might think that, since the game of golf has been around for a long, long time, it would stand to reason that the profession of golf course architect has also been around for a long, long time. You would be mistaken. The American Society of Golf Course Architects (ASGCA) dates only from the late 1940s. As you might expect, the organization has a small membership. You might also assume that, with profession. In truth, the aura exceeds the reality. What Shiels (who has coauthored books with Larry King and Donald Trump) has done is to give brief observations, stories, and insights from 118 members of the ASGCA (which sponsored the book). Of particular note, many of the golf course architects "happened" into the field, and these stories are particularly interesting. The book covers a raft of viewpoints on design issues, construction problems, client egos, and professional golfers whose sole contribution to course design is their name. Dipping into this book is sort of like meeting a new friend in a lounge for a drink and sharing a story or two. Shiels has managed to take individual observations and create a seamless story bolstered by drawings and spectacular photographs.

Richard Niebuhr published Christ and Culture, a hugely influential book that set the agenda for the church and cultural engagement for the next several decades. But Niebuhr&#39;s model was devised in and for a predominantly Christian cultural setting. How do we best understand the church and its writers in a world that is less and less Christian? Craig Carter critiques Niebuhr&#39;s still pervasive models and proposes a typology better suited to mission after Christendom.</p><p>"H. Richard Niebuhr's days are numbered. This carefully argued and well-written book should bring the curtains down on the more than fifty year reign of Niebuhr's typology in <i>Christ and Culture.</i> Carter not only shows how this paradigm is inadequate for our world but offers an alternative paradigm that is at once fuller and richer for understanding the church's social existence in the midst of a broken world that is loved by God."--Mark Thiessen Nation, author of <i>John Howard Yoder: Mennonite Patience, Evangelical Witness, Catholic Convictions</i><p>"Craig Carter has written an important book for everyone under the influence of H. Richard Niebuhr's <i>Christ and Culture,</i> for everyone committed to the church's witness in the world, and for everyone concerned about the impact of Christianity upon our common life."--Jonathan R. Wilson, author of <i>God So Loved the World</i></p><p>"This book is long overdue and much needed. Even though few works of contemporary theology are as influential as Niebuhr's <i>Christ and Culture,</i> there has been surprisingly little serious criticism of its main claims and organizing categories. Carter's stimulating book provides not only a provocative critique of Niebuhr's entire approach, it also breaks new ground by proposing an alternative understanding of the main options for the church's mission to the world."--Jeffrey P. Greenman, Wheaton College</p><p>"Craig Carter invites us to rethink critically the assumptions, arguments, and conclusions of Niebuhr's <i>Christ and Culture.</i> With a well-developed sense of our postmodern, post-Christendom circumstances, and with fidelity to both scripture and the broad Christian tradition, he challenges the quasi-canonical status accorded to Niebuhr's typology by many since the book's publication in 1951, especially in the United States."--Barry Harvey, Baylor University</p><p>"This exceedingly important and well-written book offers much more than a rethinking of Niebuhr's <i>Christ and Culture.</i> In his effort to determine what is wrong with Niebuhr's oft-cited typology, Carter digs deeply into two fundamental problems affecting not just Niebuhr but the majority of Western Christians--the church's embrace of Christendom and its unblinking support for state violence.

The direction and desirability of that influence is a matter of dispute. J. M. Porter, a political scientist, here presents revealing selections from nine of Luther&#39;s more important writings, all excerpted from the American Edition of &#39;Luther&#39;s Works.&#39; His texts suggest the complexity of the Reformer&#39;s thinking, its theological base, and the situational focus of his political utterances. Professor Porter also provides a helpful introduction in which he clarifies the meaning and implications of Luther&#39;s famous &#34;two kingdoms&#34; theory, whereby the state is freed both from domination by the church and from the temptation to dominate the conscience of its citizens. Here are to be found generous excerpts from the seminal writings which shaped the Reformation and continue to influence the course of events in our time. They illustrate Luther&#39;s innovative ideas about the nature of temporal authority, political obligation and its limits, church-state relations, and political resistance, Luther&#39;s plain and often pungent words will be of interest to students of history, religion, political science, and ethics - to everyone concerned about the issues of freedom and authority, ideology and politics, violence and nonviolence, war and freedom.</p><p>Martin Luther (1483, 1546) was a German monk, a theologian and church reformer, he is considered to be the founder of Protestantism. Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Ancient Economy</h2><p>&#34;Technical progress, economic growth, productivity, even efficiency have not been significant goals since the beginning of time,&#34; declares M.

The states of the ancient Mediterranean world had no recognizable real-property market, never fought a commercially inspired war, witnessed no drive to capital formation, and assigned the management of many substantial enterprises to slaves and ex-slaves. In short, to study the economies of the ancient world, one must begin by discarding many premises that seemed self-evident before Finley showed that they were useless or misleading.

The account of the Fifth Corps (1922-37) poignantly concludes with the original publication of this Official History just five years before Singapore fell to the Japanese - an event that was not only the most humiliating British defeat of the Second World War, but also marked the end of Empire in the Far East - of which this book is such an evocative memorial.This is the only published history of the SVC. It contains much useful information also regarding the Volunteers of the Federated Malay Stated and the Straits Settlements. Index Honours and Awards and a list of casualties for the Singapore Mutiny complete this history.</p><p></p><h2>Mama Tried: Traditional Italian Cooking for the Screwed, Crude, Vegan, and Tattooed (Vegan Cookbooks)</h2><p>Cecilia Granata grew up cooking with her family in Italy.

This moving book developed from the discovery of art work done by detainees during their stay in the camps. The authors found and taped conversations with some of the surviving artists. They reproduce here over 75 art works and excerpts from recollections, four in their entirety. The remembrances are even more powerful than the pictures. The authors provide three chapters of historical narrative, which curiously are neither in chronological sequence nor presented conveniently for those unfamiliar with the broader context.

A master of fantasy, science fiction, horror, and folklore, he has been hailed by the Irish Times as &#34;the King of Fantasy in these isles&#34;.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>The charity auction hadn&#x2019;t started until well after midnight, when the gala dinner had ended. It was almost four in the morning and the auction was only now drawing to a close. A digital display behind the celebrity auctioneer&#x2014;an actor who had played James Bond on-screen for many years&#x2014;showed the running total at more than one million euro.<br><br>&#x201c;Lot number two hundred and ten: a pair of early- nineteenth-century Japanese Kabuki masks.&#x201d;<br><br>A ripple of excitement ran through the crowded room. Inlaid with chips of solid jade, the Kabuki masks were the highlight of the auction and were expected to fetch in excess of half a million euro.<br><br>At the back of the room the tall, thin man with the fuzz of close-cropped snow white hair was prepared to pay twice that.<br><br>Niccol� Machiavelli stood apart from the rest of the crowd, arms lightly folded across his chest, careful not to wrinkle his Savile Row&#x2013;tailored black silk tuxedo. Stone gray eyes swept over the other bidders, analyzing and assessing them. There were really only five others he needed to look out for: two private collectors like himself, a minor European royal, a once-famous American movie actor and a Canadian antiques dealer. The remainder of the audience were tired, had spent their budget or were unwilling to bid on the vaguely disturbing-looking masks.<br><br>Machiavelli loved all types of masks. He had been collecting them for a very long time, and he wanted this particular pair to complete his collection of Japanese theater costumes. These masks had last come up for sale in 1898 in Vienna, and he had then been outbid by a Romanov prince. Machiavelli had patiently bided his time; the masks would come back on the market again when the Prince and his descendents died. Machiavelli knew he would still be around to buy them; it was one of the many advantages of being immortal.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we start the bidding at one hundred thousand euro?&#x201d;<br><br>Machiavelli looked up, caught the auctioneer&#x2019;s attention and nodded.<br><br>The auctioneer had been expecting his bid and nodded in return. &#x201c;I am bid one hundred thousand euro by Monsieur Machiavelli. Always one of this charity&#x2019;s most generous supporters and sponsors.&#x201d;<br><br>A smattering of applause ran around the room, and several people turned to look at him and raise their glasses. Niccol� acknowledged them with a polite smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Do I have one hundred and ten?&#x201d; the auctioneer asked.<br><br>One of the private collectors raised his hand slightly.<br><br>&#x201c;One-twenty?&#x201d; The auctioneer looked back to Machiavelli, who immediately nodded.<br><br>Within the next three minutes, a flurry of bids brought the price up to two hundred and fifty thousand euro. There were only three serious bidders left: Machiavelli, the American actor and the Canadian.<br><br>Machiavelli&#x2019;s thin lips twisted into a rare smile; his patience was about to be rewarded, and finally the masks would be his. Then the smile faded as he felt the cell phone in his back pocket buzz silently. For an instant he was tempted to ignore it; he&#x2019;d given his staff strict instructions that he was not to be disturbed unless it was absolutely critical. He also knew they were so terrified of him that they would not phone unless it was an emergency. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the ultraslim phone and glanced down.<br><br>A picture of a sword pulsed gently on the large LCD screen.<br><br>Machiavelli&#x2019;s smile vanished. In that second he knew he was not going to be able to buy the Kabuki masks this century. Turning on his heel, he strode out of the room and pressed the phone to his ear. Behind him, he could hear the auctioneer&#x2019;s hammer hit the lectern &#x201c;Sold. For two hundred and sixty thousand euro . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; Machiavelli said, reverting to the Italian of his youth.<br><br>The line crackled and an English-accented voice responded in the same language, using a dialect that had not been heard in Europe for more than four hundred years. &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d;<br><br>The man on the other end of the line didn&#x2019;t identify himself, nor did he need to; Machiavelli knew it was the immortal magician and necromancer Dr. John Dee, one of the most powerful and dangerous men in the world.<br><br>Niccol� Machiavelli strode out of the small hotel into the broad cobbled square of the Place du Tertre and stopped to breathe in the chill night air. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; he asked cautiously. He detested Dee and knew the feeling was mutual, but they both served the Dark Elders, and that meant they had been forced to work together down through the centuries. Machiavelli was also slightly envious that Dee was younger than he&#x2014;and looked it. Machiavelli had been born in Florence in 1469, which made him fifty-eight years older than the English Magician. History recorded that he had died in the same year that Dee had been born, 1527.<br><br>&#x201c;Flamel is back in Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>Machiavelli straightened. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just now. He got there through a leygate. I&#x2019;ve no idea where it comes out. He&#x2019;s got Scathach with him. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Machiavelli&#x2019;s lips curled into an ugly grimace. The last time he&#x2019;d encountered the Warrior, she&#x2019;d pushed him through a door. It had been closed at the time, and he&#x2019;d spent weeks picking splinters from his chest and shoulders.<br><br>&#x201c;There are two humani children with him. Americans,&#x201d; Dee said, his voice echoing and fading on the transatlantic line. &#x201c;Twins,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>&#x201c;Say again?&#x201d; Machiavelli asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Twins,&#x201d; Dee added, &#x201c;with pure gold and silver auras. You know what that means,&#x201d; he snapped.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Machiavelli muttered. It meant trouble. Then the tiniest of smiles curled his thin lips. It could also mean opportunity.<br><br>Static crackled and then Dee&#x2019;s voice continued. &#x201c;The girl&#x2019;s powers were Awakened by Hekate before the Goddess and her Shadowrealm were destroyed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Untrained, the girl is no threat,&#x201d; Machiavelli murmured, quickly assessing the situation. He took a breath and added, &#x201c;Except perhaps to herself and those around her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Flamel took the girl to Ojai. There, the Witch of Endor instructed her in the Magic of Air.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No doubt you tried to stop them?&#x201d; There was a hint of amusement in Machiavelli&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Tried. And failed,&#x201d; Dee admitted bitterly. &#x201c;The girl has some knowledge but is without skill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d; Machiavelli asked carefully, although he already had a very good idea.<br><br>&#x201c;Find Flamel and the twins,&#x201d; Dee demanded. &#x201c;Capture them. Kill Scathach if you can. I&#x2019;m just leaving Ojai. But it&#x2019;s going to take me fourteen or fifteen hours to get to Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What happened to the leygate?&#x201d; Machiavelli wondered aloud. If a leygate connected Ojai and Paris, then why didn&#x2019;t Dee . . . ?<br><br>&#x201c;Destroyed by the Witch of Endor,&#x201d; Dee raged, &#x201c;and she nearly killed me, too. I was lucky to escape with a few cuts and scratches,&#x201d; he added, and then ended the call without saying good-bye.<br><br>Niccol� Machiavelli closed his phone carefully and tapped it against his bottom lip. Somehow he doubted that Dee had been lucky&#x2014;if the Witch of Endor had wanted him dead, then even the legendary Dr. Dee would not have escaped. Machiavelli turned and walked across the square to where his driver was patiently waiting with the car. If Flamel, Scathach and the American twins had come to Paris via a leygate, then there were only a few places in the city where they could have emerged. It should be relatively easy to find and capture them.<br><br>And if he could capture them tonight, then he would have plenty of time to work on them before Dee arrived.<br><br>Machiavelli smiled; he&#x2019;d only need a few hours, and in that time they would tell him everything they knew. Half a millennium on this earth had taught him how to be very persuasive indeed.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>All About Cotton: A Fabric Dictionary &amp; Swatchbook (Fabric Reference Ser.; Vol. 2) (Fabric Reference Series)</h2><p>The second volume in Julie Parker's Fabric Reference Series explains the different fabrics made from cotton, using plain English instead of confusing technical jargon.

She and her husband live in Seattle.Most stores carry a wide range of cotton fabrics and cotton/polyester blends, but the quality varies considerably. Here are some tips for judging a fabric's quality before you buy: <p>Count the number of yarns per inch in both directions of the weave. Better fabrics have more yarns per square inch. </p><p>Hold the fabric up to the light. The tighter the weave, the less light will shine through. Look for uniform spacing between yarns. Beware of fabrics that appear to be thinner in some areas than others. </p><p>Inspect the twist of an individual yarn, preferably a yarn pulled from the lengthwise direction of the weave. A tightly twisted yarn is stronger and the fabric will be more durable. The presence of short, wispy fibers may be a sign of low quality yarns. </p><p>Inspect the yarns for variations in thickness. They should be uniform in size and thickness, although they may not be the same size in both directions, depending on the weave. (Keep in mind that slubbed yarns and irregular weaves are part of the appeal of some fabrics, especially handwovens.) </p><p>Scratch a small section of the fabric with your thumbnail to see if the yarns are distorted easily. Such fabrics tend to pull apart at the seams of close-fitting garments. </p><p>Check the fabric to see if the lengthwise and crosswise yarns intersect at right angles. Beware of fabrics with bowed or skewed grain. </p><p>Inspect printed fabrics to make sure the print is straight, especially in the case of stripes, plaids, checks and other designs with obvious lines. The lines of the print should match the grain or torn edge of the fabric. </p><p>Inspect printed fabrics to make sure the colors are registered, with no overlapping colors, blurred prints or white outlines around the motifs. </p><p>Rub the fabric between your hands. A heavily sized fabric will feel chalky. It may appear to be coated with a filmy or powdery substance. Such fabrics are usually inferior. </p><p>Check the fabric for loose yarns to see if it unravels easily. </p><p>On twill fabrics, examine the angle of the diagonal twill line. A steep line is a sign of a tight, compact weave and a better quality fabric. </p><p>Scrunch a small piece of fabric in your hand and release it. If the fabric remains wrinkled, it will probably wrinkle easily. </p><p>Loosely gather up to a yard of the fabric in your hand to determine how it will work with a gathered or shirred style. Unroll a yard or more of the fabric and let it hang freely to determine how it drapes and flows. </p><p>Examine the fabric for one-way designs, luster, nap or other factors that may require special handling. </p><p>Sniff the fabric for unpleasant odors that may not wash out. </p><p>Compare the price with that of similar fabrics. Although price is one sign of quality or lack thereof, it is no substitute for a thorough look at the fabric. Some fabrics are true bargains and some are not.</p></p><h2>California Pastorale: Selected Photographs 1860-1925</h2><p>Here, in remarkable historic photographs, is the Golden State of legend, the land of eternal sunshine and rich abundance.

'Barrett has vividly summoned a troubling episode from our national past.' Mail on Sunday. 'An absolutely fascinating account of life under German rule in the Channel Islands during the war. As a Guernsey girl I grew up with these stories and recognise family and friends in these pages. Duncan Barrett has done a brilliant job of reflecting the peculiar challenges that existed for those living under occupation. It is an under-told story of an extraordinary time in recent British history.'&nbsp; - Sarah Montague, The Today Programme presenter.**The new book from the Sunday Times&nbsp;bestselling author of Sugar Girls** In the summer of 1940, Britain stood perilously close to invasion. One by one, the nations of Europe had fallen to the unstoppable German&nbsp;Blitzkrieg, and Hitler&#x2019;s sights were set on the English coast. And yet, following the success of the Battle of Britain, the promised invasion never came. The prospect of German jackboots landing on British soil retreated into the realm of collective nightmares.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the spectre of what might have been is one that has haunted us down the decades, finding expression in counterfactual history and outlandish fictions. What would a British occupation have looked like?&nbsp; The answer lies closer to home than we think, in the experiences of the Channel Islanders &#x2013; the only British people to bear the full brunt of German Occupation.&nbsp; For five years, our nightmares became their everyday reality. The people of Guernsey, Jersey and Sark got to know the enemy as those on the mainland never could, watching in horror as their towns and villages were suddenly draped in Swastika flags, their cinemas began showing Nazi propaganda films, and Wehrmacht soldiers goose-stepped down their highstreets. Those who resisted the regime, such as the brave men and women who set up underground newspapers or sheltered slave labourers, encountered the full force of Nazi brutality. But in the main, the Channel Islands occupation was a &#x2018;model&#x2019; one, a prototype for how the Fuhrer planned to run mainland Britain. As a result, the stories of the islanders are not all misery and terror. Many, in fact are rather funny &#x2013; tales of plucky individuals trying to get by in almost impossible circumstances, and keeping their spirits up however they could. Unlike their compatriots on the mainland, the islanders had no Blitz to contend with, but they met the thousand other challenges the war brought with a similar indomitable spirit. The story of the Channel Islands during the war is the history that could so nearly have come to pass for the rest of us.&nbsp; Based on interviews with over a hundred islanders who lived through it, this book tells that story from beginning to end, opening the lid on life in Hitler&#x2019;s British Isles.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Duncan Barrett studied English at Cambridge University and now works as a writer and editor, specialising in biography and memoir.

Once again Wesley, Kurt and Lisa are drawn to this strange country by the wondrous Gaal. Unexpectedly, an irritating neighbor, Betty, comes along with them. Despite the problems she causes--and despite being thrown into prison, attacked by a seven-headed ogre and lost in unnatural darkness, the group seeks to follow where Gaal leads. Together they battle Lord Lunacy in a final confrontation that holds the future of Anthropos in the balance. Here is the stirring conclusion to John White&#39;s mythical adventure series that has been beloved by tens of thousands.</p><p>John White was born in Liverpool, England, on March 5, 1924, and grew up in Manchester. After serving as a reconnaissance photographer in the Fleet Air Arms during World War II, he completed medical training at Manchester University. He later participated in a variety of short-term missions efforts (including Bible smuggling!) and capitalized on many opportunities to encourage Christians behind the Iron Curtain during the beginning of the Cold War.<br><br> On June 25, 1955, White married Laureate May O'Hara. From 1955 to 1964 he served as a medical missionary with New Tribes Mission. Later he was appointed associate general secretary of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students of Latin America.<br><br> White emigrated to Canada with his family in 1965 and later completed his residency in psychiatry in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He next filled the post of associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Manitoba and also served locally as pastor of Church of the Way.<br><br> He wrote 25 books as well as numerous articles and study guides. A much sought-after speaker, he lectured around the world at churches, conferences and leadership events. During his later life, White moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, helping to plant a Vineyard church there (Surrey Vineyard) and becoming involved in the larger Vineyard Christian Fellowship.<br><br> John White died in 2002, but his written ministry lives on, with over 1.5 million of his books in print.<br>Dale Larsen is a writer living in Rochester, Minnesota.

He had spent so much time performing away from home while she was growing up that she resented rather than appreciated his talent. Writing this book helped her understand why her dad is so adored by millions of fans. The study is as much about her own hard luck as it is about Willie's rise to fame, however, and neither story line is handled very well.

Taken by surprise, the defending Iraqi armor brigade was swept away in salvos of American tank and missile fire in what became the U.S. Army's largest tank battle since World War II. Douglas Macgregor, the man who trained and led Cougar Squadron into battle, recounts two stories. One is the inspiring tale of the valiant American soldiers, sergeants, lieutenants, and captains who fought and won the battle. The other is a story of failed generalship, one that explains why Iraq's Republican Guard escaped, ensuring that Saddam Hussein's regime survived and America's war with Iraq dragged on. Certain to provoke debate, this is the latest book from the controversial and influential military veteran whose two previous books, <i>Breaking the Phalanx</i> and <i>Transformation Under Fire</i>, are credited with influencing thinking and organization inside America's ground forces and figure prominently in current discussions about military strategy and defense policies. Its fast-moving battle narrative, told from the vantage point of Macgregor's Abrams tank, and its detailed portraits of American soldiers, along with vivid descriptions of the devastating technology of mounted warfare, will captivate anyone with a taste for adventure as well as an interest in contemporary military history.</p><p>Col. Douglas Macgregor USA (Ret.) is a decorated combat veteran with a PhD in international relations from the University of Virginia. He is the author of five books and is the executive vice president of Burke-Macgregor Group LLC, a defense and foreign policy consulting firm in Northern Virginia.It is that immediacy and intensity of close combat that Warrior s Rage evokes. Macgregor depicts war as it is experienced and fought, not with neat arrows on a well-drawn map, but with seared flesh, grit, blood, dirt and pain. Exhaustion, confusion, fear and death define the world of Cougar Squadron; Macgregor describes every bit of it. Yet he also grants us a glimpse into how soldiers deal with such grim realities leadership, discipline, training<br>and humor surely help. Warrior s Rage includes all of those as well. A book like Warrior s Rage would normally be on the reading list of every fighting battalion in our Army.<br>Some will hesitate at that, though, because there is a strong subtext to Macgregor s<br>account. It s a truism of war that although good units are composed of team players, most soldiers know well that when you close that hatch, few have much good to say for those bastards back at platoon. That is a normal part of a soldier s point of view. The dangers of combat only serve to amplify this tendency. Macgregor does not spare us his opinions about his superiors. He castigates America s generals as a group and often by name for what he sees as their timidity in finishing the job in 1991. By implication, and in many cases by bald statement, a reader of Warrior s Rage would not be surprised that these generals chosen successors have fumbled around in the current war as well. That may turn off some readers, but I would encourage those offended to hang in there. Believe it or not, such things get said about most leaders in the Army maybe even Macgregor. As soldiers, we have learned after a lot of failed operations at the National Training Center let alone on the ground in theater to be brutal on ourselves, to ask the hard questions and to own up to mistakes. Our Army judges by results more than by form or style. The ability to adapt under fire is the key to winning. Macgregor s Cougars did it at 73 Easting, but ourselves, to ask the hard questions and to own up to mistakes. Our Army judges by results more than by form or style. The ability to adapt under fire is the key to winning. Macgregor s Cougars did it at 73 Easting, but it all starts with the guts to accept criticism. Macgregor himself offers the best<br>explanation for why his harsh tone still makes Warrior s Rage well worth the read. At one point, describing a particularly headstrong cavalry troop commander (now a serving general officer), Macgregor approvingly quotes Werner Binder, a German officer who fought on the Eastern Front in World War II: Your best commander is always your most difficult subordinate. He always asks hard questions and offers new ways to do things, because he thinks. He may be quick-tempered and occasionally insubordinate, but if you have one like<br>this, give him the freedom to do what he thinks is right whenever possible. Macgregor did just that, and the outcome was a signal victory. I think Binder s advice may be good for anyone who reads Warrior s Rage. The author of Breaking the Phalanx and Transformation<br>Under Fire has never been a shrinking violet Macgregor was always a most difficult subordinate. But he s also one of the smartest and most gifted armored commanders our Army has produced. Warrior s Rage is just the latest fine contribution from a veteran cavalryman who will no doubt stay in the fight for the Army he loves. --Army Magazine, MG Daniel P.

(lead partner, Potomac League, LLC; Breaking the Phalanx) trained and led Cougar Squadron, the 2nd Squadron of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, into the open desert in pursuit of Iraq s Re --Library Journal<br><br>In Warrior's Rage, retired Col. Douglas Macgregor gives us two books. One is a graphic account of the obliteration of an Iraqi Republican Guard brigade by the 2nd Squadron of the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment during the Gulf War. Since the author filled the number two slot in the squadron, and was instrumental in how it trained and the tactics it used, and since he believed in leading from the front in his own combat tank, he probably witnessed more of the conflict than anyone, and thus is an ideal narrator. His second theme is a blistering critique of the colonels and generals who led the Army and who, he believes, frittered away the monumental victory the company grade officers and enlisted men tried to give them. Both accounts are graphic and passionate and show the author's deep concern for the future of the U.S. Army...The author feels that the abundance of errors in thinking lies primarily in what he calls the corporate culture of the Army. The way to get promoted, as in any bureaucracy, is not to make mistakes. The way to avoid mistakes is not to do anything. And before long you are on the promotion list. Col. Macgregor has written other books on how to improve the Army. Presumably he will continue to do so. He may not always be right, but he is worth listening to. --Sol Schindler, The Washington Times</p><h2>The Shadow Taker</h2><p>When a young and aggressive businessmnan&#39;s jeep breaks down in the middle of the San Juan slickrock desert in Southeastern Utah, he meets an old man who gives him water and feeds him, an old man he has never before seen.

With a strong sense of color and design and a mastery of computer rendering, Kolar takes children on a crazy race that is pleasantly reminiscent of P. D. Eastman's<i> Go Dog Go! </i>but with its own special twist. Here the dogs race against one another. Children will be rewarded for their scrutiny by a wealth of tiny details in the art. They'll also delight in learning the racers' names, discovering their distinctive personalities, watching the hectic unfolding of the race, and pulling out the many backstories Kolar works in--among them, a comical version of the tortoise-hare duel that goes on during the main race. Devotees of J. Otto Sebold will certainly see a resemblance in Kolar's pictures, which are warm, amiable, and busy at times though lacking the sense of chaos that characterizes Sebold's work. All in all, this is a handsome, enjoyable book, especially for children willing to spend time deconstructing the pictures. <i>Tim Arnold</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this stunningly original book Maureen N. McLane channels the spirits and voices that make up the music in one poet's mind. Weaving criticism and memoir, <i>My Poets</i> explores a life reading and a life read. McLane invokes in <i>My Poets</i> not necessarily the best poets, nor the most important poets (whoever these might be), but those writers who, in possessing her, made her. "I am marking here what most marked me," she writes. Ranging from Chaucer to H.D. to William Carlos Williams to Louise Gl�ck to Shelley (among others), McLane tracks the "growth of a poet's mind," as Wordsworth put it in <i>The Prelude</i>. In a poetical prose both probing and incantatory, McLane has written a radical book of experimental criticism. Susan Sontag called for an "erotics of interpretation": this is it. Part <i>Bildung</i>, part dithyramb, part exegesis, <i>My Poets</i> extends an implicit invitation to you, dear reader, to consider who your "my poets," or "my novelists," or "my filmmakers," or "my pop stars," might be.</p></p><p><p><b>Maureen N. McLane</b> is the author of two collections of poetry, <i>Same Life</i> (FSG, 2008) and <i>World Enough</i> (FSG, 2010). <i>My Poets</i> (FSG, 2012) was a finalist for the 2012 National Book Critics Circle Award for autobiography.</p><p>&#x201c;To read McLane is to be reminded that the brain may be an organ, but the mind is a muscle. Hers is a roving, amphibious intelligence; she's at home in the essay and the fragment, the polemic and the elegy. She can be confessional and clinical and ludic--sometimes all in the same sentence. What I'm trying to say is that McLane has <i>moves</i>. In her new book, <i>My Poets</i>, she invites us to read over her shoulder as she combs through &#x2018;her' poets, including Chaucer, H.D., Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Louise Gl�ck. It's a work of personal and poetic archaeology . . . The prose is thick with quotation and self-interrogation . . . Forensically close readings dovetail with spirited defenses of the poets posterity has misunderstood, fresh readings of the familiar, and formal experiments . . . It's a visceral kind of criticism, sexy, strange, suspenseful . . . Language enters McLane's body like a current. Her whole body bucks and shudders. Her responses are forcefully somatic . . . and matched by the syntactical sophistication of her thought, her attraction to contradiction . . . McLane's personality, her laconic wit and iconoclasm, suffuse this book . . . There is explicit autobiography here, too, painful self-disclosure, that gives the book its emotional torque . . . This isn't the language of criticism; this is the language of seduction, a celebration of yearning, of not-knowing and not-having . . . Susan Sontag called for an erotics of art. <i>My Poets</i> is that more; it is an erotics of epistemology. A celebration of meaning and mystification, of the pleasures and necessity of kankedort. As McLane writes, &#x2018;All honor to those who wave the pure flag of a difficult joy.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Parul Sehgal, Bookforum</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] beguiling new book . . . Genially, charismatically subversive . . . In this book McLane comes into contact--repeatedly, playfully, and with great seriousness--with verbal art, and is changed by it. <i>My Poets</i> is a delightful shock. It's also a friendly book, inviting readers by its own example to let poems change them too . . . McLane recognizes that we all read with baggage. She reports on that baggage, miraculously without the cloistered narcissism typical of memoir. It's part of this book's strength, and its broad appeal, that McLane is willing to get personal while also tossing off niftily worded assessments of poems . . . <i>My Poets</i> is McLane's story of learning to embrace the ambivalence of her own taste in poems and in people, and of learning to live and read in contradiction . . . Poetry clarifies our loneliness, restores textures to life's flatness and abysses, makes the world bigger, and closer. Perhaps it makes us interesting, even beautiful, or anyway, human. McLane's many dictions and registers, her playful digressions and pouncing aper�us, her fast foot-work that takes her from sorrow to arch amusement in half a sentence, work to demonstrate that.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daisy Fried, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Those seeking a critical introduction to Chaucer, Elizabeth Bishop, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore, H.D., Louise Gl�ck, Fanny Howe, Dickinson or Shelley--Ms. McLane's titular poets--will find something much more exhilarating . . . and impassioned. At a time when execrable "lyric essays" flourish as an excuse to avoid critical thinking, Ms. McLane has written lyrical essays that justify the genre . . . Ms. McLane's discussions of her poets are interwoven with autobiographical accounts of what was going on in her life when she discovered them . . . she is able to elucidate why poetry can <i>matter</i> to a life without straining for the unconvincing uplift that mars so many books on poetry written for a general audience . . . [McLane] is clearly having fun . . . If you already love poetry, Ms. McLane's book will rekindle old passions and ignite new ones. And if you don't already love poetry, well, the central insight of <i>My Poets</i>, as of all literary criticism, is laid out in Ms. McLane's chapter on &#x2018;My Shelley / (My Romantics)': &#x2018;I had no imagination so I sought out the imaginers' . . . There's no way to convince a young person who doesn't read that in order to have an imagination one must first seek out the imaginers, that without them a life is less. You can only place a book in her hands and hope for a spark. This book would do.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Robbins, The New York Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Over the course of the 15 chapters of <i>My Poets</i>, McLane leads us (and herself) back down the paths she took to the poets and poems she loves, showing us where she stumbled along the way--and in doing so, authorizing us to trip and fall, too. (Or, perhaps, to veer off course entirely.) Throughout, McLane stays true to that proven tenet of poetic practice: Show, don't tell . . . This isn't just McLane clicking "Like" on a pantheon of poetry all-stars. These are her readings, her connections, her poets, and her weird, winding trail from one to the other . . . They highlight her impressive directness and clarity, her keen ear for language, and a deep well of memory . . . reading McLane's readings is like following the faint lines of a crude map she drew as she forged intuitively along . . . One of the most enjoyable features of <i>My Poets</i> is the sheer agility of McLane's poetic imagination, the ease with which one line awakens another . . . An invigorating mix of criticism, memoir, and marginalia from a writing life, <i>My Poets</i> wisely avoids slapping another sales pitch on poetry. If anything, McLane shows that poetry, and the wonders within, have been ours all along. She reminds us that poetry is bigger than all of us, yet exclusive to each of us; and that, when faced with a difficult poem, the reader's role is never to tame it, but perhaps to simply heed some other wise words from Moore: &#x2018;The thing is to see the vision and not deny it; to care and admit that we do.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Andor Brodeur, The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Throughout <i>My Poets</i>, her collection of beautiful, experimental essays, McLane's thinking through and appraising other poets is the central, commanding event . . . McLane's native attitude is soulful, metaphysical and witty . . . Together in the haze, McLane and her poets possess each other . . . thinking through these lines for meaning, syncopating confession with critique, McLane demonstrates across this gorgeous, humming collection, that we turn to poetry, as Dickinson sings, &#x2018;To Keep the Dark away.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Walton Muyumba, NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;McLane is deliriously in love with poetry, and <i>My Poets</i> is an audacious, challenging, endearing work that defies all categorization . . . McLane's spiky, precise prose veers, slips and blooms into poetry and back again. Her choices are self-declaredly personal and deeply idiosyncratic. Ranging widely over the English and American literary tradition, McLane underscores the arbitrariness of what in a writer strikes us, moves us, grips us, lingers with us . . . Like her beloved Dickinson, McLane is a fearless explorer of the &#x2018;liminal zone' in both life and art. Hers is a book about haunting, possession, and the fluidity of identity: &#x2018;you are never sure what you might be made by.' McLane makes herself vulnerable, again and again, to poetry's surprising power and allows herself to be transformed, shaken up, transfigured by it . . . <i>My Poets</i> is at once an exuberant, even giddy, reveling in poetic fecundity and a carefully controlled and highly crafted analysis of individual poets and poems. Searching and at times sentimental but never wimpy, impassioned but never strident, it's a little history not only of the growth of a poet's mind but also of the shaping of a sensibility, an ethic and a character. And it's a testament to the vital relevance of literature to our daily lives.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Priscilla Gilman, The Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a vital, personal book about books, the idiosyncratic poetics of poets and poems. <i>My Poets</i> reminds us that the realm of letters remains a republic, in which the books we read tell the stories of our own lives . . . <i>My Poets </i>emphasizes its adjective and its noun alike. McLane offers openly--and brilliantly--what some critics refuse to admit: Her idiosyncrasies are her only way of reading, as mine are mine, yours yours.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dave Lucas, The Plain Dealer (Cleveland)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Maureen N. McLane's <i>My Poets</i> is a strange, provocative hybrid of criticism, memoir and poetry . . . in many ways strikingly original, <i>My Poets</i> charts the genesis of McLane's development as a reader and writer, from the baffled Harvard undergraduate encountering Charles Olson and Frank O'Hara for the first time (she bravely offers us her youthful marginalia to the "The Day Lady Died") to her current position as a poet and critic of great sensitivity and sophistication . . . Often McLane allows her prose to be contaminated by her subjects, or, rather, sets herself the task of animating them, a kind of ventriloquism that works both as homage and as a springboard for a flexible, suggestive form of criticism whose possibilities extend beyond those of more traditional exegesis . . . The subtlety and humour with which McLane traces these elusive dialogues between a large cast of poets, all the while describing their entanglement with and influence on the course of her own life and thought, make for an exhilarating, and often very moving, book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Oli Hazzard, The Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is no layman's guide to poetry. In this unusual book that can only be described as a love song--written in a jumpy yet satisfying mixture of prose criticism, memoir, anecdote, and imitative verse written in tribute--McLane, herself a poet and acclaimed critic of poetry, presents an esoteric tour of her personal pantheon, the poets that have shaped her life. McLane (<i>World Enough</i>) devotes a chapter to one or two poets at a time, and while her picks are not surprising, they are all treated surprisingly: McLane forever associates Chaucer, for instance, with the word "Kankedort," "a lonely word whose definition can only be inferred from its single, immediate context in Chaucer's poem." In "My Elizabeth Bishop / (My Gertrude Stein)," McLane makes another unlikely pairing when her failed undergraduate thesis on Stein leads her to a lifelong love of Bishop, casting the essay in flowing, a-grammatical Stein sentences: "Why did I want to be made by Stein. / She is of course very fine. Everyone thinks so except those who don't." Those who know a lot about contemporary poetry will find this book packed to the gills with in-jokes, deep knowledge, and scars and scuff marks from a life lived in poetry's trenches. Newer poetry readers will be lured deeper by McLane's boundless enthusiasm.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;The author of two collections (2010's <i>World Enough</i> was an LJ Best Poetry Book), McLane writes musically astute lines that deliver a sharp and gratifying sense of story, character, or place; her poems are wonderful to dwell in. So it's a delight to learn that she's offering this book, not a study of poetry but of how certain poets have shaped her writing, her thinking, her very life. She thus presents her own story and literary exegesis as two sides of the same bright coin, and we meet her as we meet Chaucer, Shelley, Louise Gl�ck, and more. I'm expecting a lot of this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;An acclaimed poet considers the predecessors who shaped her art and life in this idiosyncratic mix of literary survey and intellectual biography. Using her skills as a poet and critic, McLane . . . examines the major poets of her life and the inspiration and technique she drew from each. There's Elizabeth Bishop, &#x2018;a sea to breathe in once the gills you needed grew and breathing grew less strange.' From William Carlos Williams she learned to draw from her own pure and crazy American experience. She dissects Marianne Moore's poem &#x2018;Marriage' at length, weighing it against her own failed marriage and subsequent same-sex relationship. She identifies with H.D. (Hilda Doolittle), the closeted lesbian, and finds that her poem &#x2018;Oread' &#x2018;bespeaks our desire to commune, to hear and be heard, to make the chaos of inner feeling not only sentient but sharable.' McLane responds to Louise Gl�ck's powerful willfulness and finds that Fanny Howe's poems reveal &#x2018;a refusal to turn away even as they seek asylum...to participate in the sick fictions of success or easy safety.' Percy Bysshe Shelley is the muse of the author's sexual radicalism; she loves his youth, excess and intelligence. &#x2018;To immerse yourself in him is to move through an extraordinary medium of thinking songs, sung thoughts,' she writes. McLane's book is a gutsy poetic act on its own, as she writes measured, metrical prose that alters between rhythmic and affected, dropping commas or shifting perspective at will, as if in mimicry of her subjects. A perceptive reflection on the reading and writing life by a poet who has embraced her own personal anxiety of influence.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;Bridging the many worlds she's traveled, McLane brings us <i>My Poets</i>, an account of her own life as a reader of poetry. <i>My Poets</i> is itself part prose and part poem, part analysis, part autobiography. Even as she asks what it means to try to account for the mind that works through texts, her texts themselves are hybrids that allow us into her uncertainties, her notes, her obsessions with the poets who &#x2018;infect her.' Sharing the actions of the working mind, these new writings examine how thought and art shape one another. In lucky moments we also glimpse how new art might come into being . . . [A] revealing work . . . innovative, intellectual play.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tess Taylor, Barnes &amp; Noble Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;McLane . . . conducts a daring experiment in <i>My Poets</i>. It includes close readings of, among others, Marianne Moore, H.D., Fanny Howe, and Louise Gl�ck; personal essays, poems, a marvelous abecedarian ode to translators, and tributes in the form of a cento (meaning "patchwork")--that is, a poem constructed of lines from other poems. In sum, McLane has created an unusual book of personal responses, some measured, some excessive, all passionate efforts to capture the myriad sensations of poetry, to sustain the moment of encounter, and to avoid criticism that diminishes the effects of poetry . . . The writing . . . is exceptional throughout: vigorous, specific, and occasionally virtuosic, as in this comparison between Moore and H.D., in which the language mirrors and celebrates its subject . . . At her best, McLane is among a handful of necessary critics.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Autrey, Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Some poems smack of a gentility one would like in some moods to smack out of them.' Even before I read that sentence--about the sainted Elizabeth Bishop!--I knew Maureen McLane was the poetry teacher for me. Her first book of criticism, <i>My Poets</i>, is the survey course of my dreams: a long, loving argument with and about everyone from Chaucer to Gertrude Stein. As befits her subject, McLane is both plainspoken and lyrical, falling at times, as if naturally, into verse as clear as her prose.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lorin Stein, The Paris Review Daily</i></p><p>&#x201c;Although [<i>My Poets</i>] was a finalist for the 2012 National Book Critics Circle award in the category of autobiography, it is more than an autobiog...</p></p><h2>Country Bear&#39;s Good Neighbor</h2><p>Country Bear borrows all the ingredients for a cake from his neighbor and then gives her the cake as a present</p><p><b>Larry Dane Brimner </b>is the author of more than seventy books for children, including <i>Country Bear's Surprise; Cat on Wheels; Elliot Fry's Good-Bye; Max and Felix; Merry Christmas, Old Armadillo; </i>and <i>If Dogs Had Wings. </i>Mr. Brimner lives in San Diego, California.<br><br><b>Ruth Tietjen Councell </b>is the illustrator of <i>Country Bear's Surprise </i>and <i>Once Upon a Bedtime Story </i>by Jane Yolen. She lives in Illinois with her family.One by one, Country Bear borrows a number of ingredients from the little girl who lives next door: first apples, then sugar, an egg, and so on. Finally, the girl loses patience and proclaims "absolutely not!" before he even makes clear his request. Happily, this time he has come not to borrow but to share the cake concocted from her offerings. Soft, light-infused pictures fill out the story, which will seem mild to those who guess early on that the bear will eventually borrow every ingredient. By using different background scenery for every act of lending, Councell forms a contrast to the girl's repeated pronouncements on her neighborliness ("You are lucky I am a good neighbor"), but her facial expressions appear somewhat static. Still, for both author and artist, this is a sweet debut, which includes a recipe for "Country Bear's Good Neighbor Cake."

A physicist once employed on the Large Hadron Collider, he now uses a revolutionary and highly secret system of computer algorithms to trade on the world's financial markets. None of his rivals is sure how he does it, but somehow Hoffman's hedge fund -- built around the standard measure of market volatility: the VIX or "Fear Index" -- generates astonishing returns for his investors.<br><br>Late one night, in his house beside Lake Geneva, an intruder disturbs Hoffman and his wife while they are asleep. This terrifying moment is the start of Robert Harris's new novel -- a story just as compelling and timely as his most recent contemporary thriller, <b>The Ghost</b>. Over the next 48 hours, as the markets edge towards another great crash, Hoffman's world disintegrates. But who is trying to destroy him?</p><p><strong>Christopher Reich Reviews <i>The Fear Index</i></strong> <p></p> <p>Is there a genre of fiction that Robert Harris has not mastered? His first novel, <em>Fatherland</em>, set in a triumphant Germany&#x2019;s post-World War II Berlin (yes, triumphant!) ranks as one of the finest &#x201c;what if?&#x201d; stories ever written. <em>Pompeii</em> sends us farther back in time, to the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius only days before the volcano was set to erupt. Ancient Rome at its pulpiest. Who knew aqueducts could be so sexy? <em>The Ghost Writer</em> (winner of the 2008 International Thriller Writers award for Best Novel) claims the shadowy world of contemporary North Atlantic politics as its subject. Classy Brit espionage best enjoyed with a gin and tonic in hand. All were international bestsellers. All were page-turners non-pareil. But best, all were frighteningly intelligent. Thrillers that made you think as you maddeningly bit your nails.</p> <p>With <i>The Fear Index</i>, Mr. Harris has turned his gimlet eye on the secret world of billion dollar hedge funds, namely those that seek to earn profits by computer driven program trading. The result is a wholly unique entertainment: a strange, compelling, and utterly propulsive novel. I&#x2019;m not sure who would enjoy it more: George Soros, Arthur C. Clarke or Edgar Allen Poe. </p> <p>The story takes place over a tumultuous twenty-four hour period in the life of Dr. Alexander Hoffmann, computer scientist, mathematical genius, and, of late, hedge fund billionaire. It begins (as a fine thriller should) on a dark and stormy night when Hoffmann is awoken by an intruder inside his sixty million dollar villa on the shores of Lake Geneva. A confrontation occurs, Hoffmann is injured, and in his attempt to solve just how someone was able to gain entry into his well-guarded palace, Hoffmann comes face to face with the greatest danger he can imagine: himself. Or perhaps it&#x2019;s more accurate to say: his intellect. To reveal more would ruin the adventure...and adventure it is. </p> <p>There is, however, a backstory. Hoffmann was not always a stock trader. He began his career as a computer scientist at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) where his work in artificial intelligence involved modeling sophisticated algorithms that programmed computers to teach themselves. It is this mastery of algorithms, and how they train computers to mimic human behavior, that he has turned to such profitable use at Hoffmann Investment Technologies. And it is this mastery that will come to haunt him. </p> <p>What Harris does so admirably--in my mind, better than any other writing today--is intertwine nifty, page turning plots with important historical, political, or in this case, sociological questions. The late Michael Crichton did this kind of story well. In <i>The Fear Index</i>, Robert Harris does it fantastically. </p>ROBERT HARRIS is the author of <b>Fatherland</b>, <b>Enigma</b>, <b>Archangel</b>, <b>Pompeii</b>, <b>Imperium </b>and <b>The Ghost</b>, all of which were international bestsellers.

The authors cover various aspects of his life and career, including his troubled friendship with George Gershwin and an account of how his second wife kept him alive through countless drug withdrawals and hospital interventions. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Sam Kashner teaches at the College of William and Mary in Virginia.Why does Oscar Levant, memorable mostly for his devastating put-downs, deserve a biography at all, let alone one this long? Kashner and Schoenberger answer that question convincingly. This husband-and-wife team of poets (both teach writing at the College of William and Mary) make an auspicious nonfiction debut with this biography. At one time Levant was the highest-paid concert artist in America, and one of the most popular. But by the time of his death he was remembered mainly as a deeply troubled yet very witty man, best known for a series of terrifyingly frank appearances on the Jack Paar Show in which he discussed his barbiturate addiction and nervous breakdowns with a candor unheard of at the time. In fact, as this biography makes clear, Levant was, in spite of an almost hallucinatory catalogue of neurotic compulsions and phobias, a composer of promise, a talented pianist with a wide range of musical strengths (although most widely remembered for his interpretations of Gershwin, his close friend), and a man of uncommon intelligence and erudition. The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants who raised him to love music, Levant was an autodidact who entered the most elevated literary and musical circles of New York and Hollywood from the Jazz Age into the Eisenhower years before mental illness and drugs wrecked his health, his marriage, and his life. The book retells this story in great detail, but almost never drags. There are several minor errors in passages of historical background (Babe Ruth made his debut in the Yankee outfield in 1920, not in 1922). A genuinely thoughtful and entertaining biography that should go far in rebuilding Levant's reputation as a serious musician. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In &#34;The Cost of Discipleship&#34;, he focuses on the most treasured part of Christ&#39;s teaching, the Sermon on the Mount.</p><p>"When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die." With these words, in <i>The Cost of Discipleship</i>, Dietrich Bonhoeffer gave powerful voice to the millions of Christians who believe personal sacrifice is an essential component of faith. Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor and theologian, was an exemplar of sacrificial faith: he opposed the Nazis from the first and was eventually imprisoned in Buchenwald and hung by the Gestapo in 1945. <i>The Cost of Discipleship</i>, first published in German in 1937, was Bonhoeffer's answer to the questions, "What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us to-day?" Bonhoeffer's answers are rooted in Lutheran grace and derived from Christian scripture (almost a third of the book consists of an extended meditation on the Sermon on the Mount). The book builds to a stunning conclusion: its closing chapter, "The Image of Christ," describes the believer's spiritual life as participation in Christ's incarnation, with a rare and epigrammatic confidence: "Through fellowship and communion with the incarnate Lord," Bonhoeffer writes, "we recover our true humanity, and at the same time we are delivered from that individualism which is the consequence of sin, and retrieve our solidarity with the whole human race." --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>"When Christ calls a man, he bid him come and die." Those powerful words from Dietrich Bonhoeffer startle pop Christianity today.<p> This book is quite simply, one of the most profound and important books of the 20th century. Dietrich Bonhoeffer lived a testimony of his thoughtful and engaging writings.</p><p> It focuses on the most treasured part of Christ's teaching - the Sermon on the Mount with its call to discipleship, and on the grace of God and the sacrifice which that demands.</p><p> Viewed against the background of Nazi Germany, Bonhoeffer's book is striking enough. At the same time, it shares with many great Christian classics a quality of timelessness, so that it has spoken, and continues to speak powerfully, to the varied concerns of the contemporary world.</p></p><h2>American Log Homes</h2><p>This book features more than fifty photographs of log homes, floor plans for more than twenty homes, a concise history of log building in America, and suggestions for those interested in building a log home</p><p>Cindy Thiede has spent twenty years photographing and writing about log-home architecture in the United States.

Sayers was an English writer, translator, and Christian humanist. Best known for the extremely popular Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series, Sayers also penned a number of plays, including The Man Born to Be King, essays, and translations, of which she considered Dante s Divine Comedy to be her best. Sayers died in 1950, and is buried in St. Anne s Church in London.Ian Carmichael personified Lord Peter Wimsey for a generation of public television viewers. His affection for the brainy, finicky, aristocratic detective is clear in this reading. In addition to creating a well-drawn Wimsey, he imbues solid Bunter with the humor and patience that Sayers blended into his personality. All the other characters in this tale of countryside bell ringing gone wrong are so perfectly vivid that listeners may find themselves chortling with pleasure as they listen. The only quibble is that Carmichael's reading voice is the same as the one he gives to Lord Peter, leading to some confusion between the narrative and the dialogue spoken by Wimsey. But no matter, this is still a long evening's pleasure.

Her father, Aaron&#x2014;Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s vice president, most famous for his great duel with Alexander Hamilton&#x2014;holds sway over young Theodosia&#x2019;s heart. But his arrogance forces her to choose between the man he insists she marry and her love for a young soldier who will turn out to play a decisive role in her father&#x2019;s fate. Persuaded by Aaron that through his treasonable plans she will soon be crowned princess of the Kingdom of Mexico, she is received like royalty on Blennerhassett Island, only to end up trying to exonerate her father as he awaits trial in a Richmond jail, repudiated by his fickle son-in-law and friends.<br>Theodosia remains a haunting figure in American history, still lovely, still imperious, never vanquished.</p><p>Chicago Review Press paperback, 2007, previous ISBN 978-15-56527272ANYA SETON (1904&#x2013;1990) was the author of many best-selling historical novels, including <i>Katherine, Avalon, Dragonwyck, Devil Water,</i> and <i>Foxfire</i>.

In the title novella and six subsequent stories, Lind distorts and refashions reality to make the deepest horrors of the twentieth century his own.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Set during World War II, &#x201c;Soul of Wood&#x201d; is the story of Wohlbrecht, a peg-legged veteran of World War I, who smuggles Anton Barth, a paralyzed Jewish boy, to a mountain hideout after the boy&#x2019;s parents have been sent to their deaths. Abandoning the helpless boy to the elements, Wohlbrecht returns to Vienna, where, having been committed to an insane asylum, he helps the chief psychiatrist to administer lethal injections to other patients. But Germany is collapsing and the war will soon be over. The one way, Wohlbrecht realizes, that he can evade retribution is by returning to the woods to redeem &#x201c;his&#x201d; hidden Jew. Others, however, have had the same bright idea.</p><p><b>Jakov Lind </b>(1927&#x2013;2007) was born Heinz Jakov Landwirth into an educated Jewish family in Vienna. After the 1938 Anschluss, Lind and one of his sisters were sent for safety to Holland, from where they were join their parents in Palestine; this proved impossible, and following the occupation of Holland, Lind, who was already fluent in Dutch, had no choice but to go into hiding. Taking the name of Jan Gerrit Overbeek&#x2014;&#x201c;sailing under a false self,&#x201d; as he would later describe it&#x2014;he worked on a barge traveling up and down the Rhine. When the Allies began to bomb the industrial cities of the Rhine, Lind/Overbeek moved to Germany, where he was employed by a Nazi government ministry in Berlin. The end of the war allowed Lind to join his family in Palestine, but it was not long before he returned to Europe, studying drama in Vienna and, in 1954, settling in London, where he began work on the stories that were published in 1962 as <i>Soul of Wood. </i>Lind&#x2019;s other books in German include the novels <i>Landscape in Concrete</i> and <i>Ergo</i> and, in English, four volumes of autobiography, two novels, and numerous stories. Lind was also a playwright and film director, as well as a talented visual artist. In a eulogy delivered at Lind&#x2019;s funeral, Anthony Rudolf described Lind as &#x201c;A coyote, a trickster.... A wicked smile played around his mouth, while witty aphorisms and deep insights tripped off his lips. He emanated inner strength&#x2014;and an electric intelligence that we all wanted to emulate.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Ralph Manheim </b>(1907&#x2013;1992) translated more than one hundred books, primarily from German and French.

This fourth edition is the most radically revised, according to the publisher. Thirty maps have been replaced, and another 29 have been substantially changed. All the drawings that appeared in the last edition have been replaced by photographs.<p>Parker, Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History at Yale, is the new editor, and there are more than 30 new contributors. Notable is the large number of new contributors for South and Southeast Asia. British spellings have been replaced with American ones, and gender-neutral words have been substituted for gender-specific ones.</p><p>Changes in both maps and text are numerous and incorporate recent historiography and archaeology. For example, the map of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica now includes recently discovered Mayan sites at Lamanai and Tipu. There is a new map on the Portuguese exploration of Africa. Perhaps the most notable new spread is one entitled "Europe from 1973," which describes the dramatic developments in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Maps illustrate the European Community and the fall of Communism. The last spread in the atlas, formerly "The World in the 1980s," is now "The World in the 1990s," with new maps illustrating such things as international trade in illicit drugs and ozone depletion.</p><p>A noticeable omission is a large-scale political map describing the breakup of the former Soviet Union. Also, a map illustrating the Persian Gulf War would have been useful. Nevertheless, virtually every aspect of this thoroughly revised work has been improved, from maps with more distinct colors to the introduction of photographs.</p><p>Retaining its reputation as the most useful historical atlas, the Hammond <i>Times Atlas of World History</i> is an essential purchase for most libraries. At $95 it is a bargain, only $10 more than the third edition. <i></i></p></p><h2>Animation Unlimited: Innovative Short Films Since 1940</h2><p><p>Featuring 50 seminal short films by key animators from around the world, this book discusses the work of early pioneers such as Oskar Fischinger and Jan Svankmajer as well as contemporary animators such as Larry Cuba, Tim Hope and Run Wrake. All of the films included are independently produced personal work. Most of the featured directors make a living in commercial animation but, freed from the constraints of a client brief, they use their short films to experiment with new ideas and techniques, many of which subsequently find their way into commercial applications. Labors of love, these films can take years to complete &#x2013; each second of the film may consist of up to 25 frames of animation. Grouped according to four main themes, all forms of animation are covered, including 2D, 3D, Claymation, stop frame and web/Flash animation. Each project is accompanied by a 500-word review including comments from the director. Details of software and method along with the internet address of the production company are given in the technical credits.</p></p><p><p>Liz Faber is a&nbsp;communications director and designer whose previous books include <em>Browser: The Internet Design Project</em> and <em>Reload: Browser 2.0 </em>(written with Patrick Burgoyne). &nbsp;</p></p><h2>Dan Graham (Phaidon Contemporary Artist Series)</h2><p>Dan Graham is among the most influential of the Conceptual artists who emerged in America during the mid 1960s. A pioneer in performance and video art in the 1970s, Graham later turned his attention to architectural projects designed for social interaction in public spaces, among them The Children&#39;s Pavilion (1989) with Jeff Wall. Writing has always been a major aspect of Graham&#39;s work. His texts range from early Conceptual art pieces inserted in mass-market magazines, to writing on his fellow artists, to analyses of popular culture, from Dean Martin to the post-Punk era. Well-known also among architects and urban theorists, during the 1990s Graham has been offered major public commissions throughout North America and Europe. London-based curator Mark Francis discusses with the artist how his public participation-based work has evolved. Brussels-based critic Birgit Pelzer draws on her extensive knowledge of Graham&#39;s work and writings. New York-based architectural theorist Beatriz Colomina focuses on Graham&#39;s Alteration to a Suburban House (1978). The artist has chosen an extract from the science fiction novel Ubik by Philip K. Dick, whose writings were a formative influence. A substantial Artist&#39;s Writings section, key to understanding Dan Graham, completes the book.</p><p>Birgit Pelzer is a widely respected curator and critic who has been active since the late 1960s. Her publications include Gerhard Richter, 100 Paintings (1998) and Michael Asher (1991). Her important writings on Conceptual art have been anthologized in Rewriting Conceptual Art (1999). Mark Francis is a curator and critic based in London. He was previously Founding Director and Chief Curator of The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, and has curated exhibitions at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London. He has organized exhibitions and written on Graham&#39;s work since 1978.

His ultimate destination is Santiago de Compostela. Humorous, affecting, and reflective, these essays beautifully describe the author&#x2019;s journeys through this mysterious and mystical land. Black and-white photographs. Translated by Ina Rilke.<br></p><p>A worthy travel book does not encourage a reader to follow in the author's footsteps in search of the "good spots" so much as it creates a sense of adventure and the desire to understand a place. In <i>Roads to Santiago: Detours and Riddles in the Lands and History of Spain,</i> Dutch author Cees Nooteboom seeks out the soul and spirit of Spain in a way that suggests a journey of self-discovery as much as an actual expedition. Although the stated goal is to reach Santiago de Compostela--a church in northwest Spain that was once the object of pilgrimages during the Middle Ages--Nooteboom doesn't follow a single or direct route to the village. The more serendipitous the journey, the better. Nooteboom followed many "detours," taking nearly every back road he found and making sure to avoid anything resembling a major thoroughfare or urban center. The result of his circuitous travels is this collection of moving essays on Spain's history, geography, architecture, and people.CEES NOOTEBOOM was born in 1933 in The Hague. He has published nine novels and over a dozen collections of travel writing, including Roads to Santiago.

His works reflect a sentiment of art for pleasure's sake, without the ethical or moral overtones, which perhaps accounts for his enduring popularity. For more than two thousand years, readers have delighted in Ovid's playful eloquence; his influence on other writers has ranged from Dante and Chaucer to Shakespeare and Milton, and scenes from his stories have inspired many great works by Western artists.<br>This selection of thirty stories from the verse translation by F. A. Wright of Ovid's famous work, <i>The Metamorphoses</i>, does full justice to the poet's elegance and wit. All of the tales involve a form of metamorphosis, or transformation, and are peopled by mythological gods, demigods, and mortals: Venus and Adonis, Pygmalion, Apollo and Daphne, Narcissus, Perseus, and Andromeda, Orpheus and Eurydice, the Cyclops, and Circe, among others.<br>Although most of the stories did not originate with Ovid, it is quite possible that had he not written them down, these oral traditions would have been lost forever &#x2014; and with them, a vast and valuable amount of Greco-Roman culture.

At eight thirty, when he went down the corridor to the public lavatory, she was dressed and waiting, and simply walked out past the nurses&#x2019; station. It stood empty. The robo-nurse was still making the eight o&#x2019;clock rounds of the wing&#x2019;s seventy or eighty rooms. The organic nurse, just come on duty, was leaning over the vid display in the alcove behind the station, familiarizing herself with the day&#x2019;s new admissions.<br> <br>Because it was the nearest point of escape, Teo used the staircase. But the complex skill of descending stairs had lately deserted her, so she stepped down like a child, one leg at a time, grimly clutching the metal banister with uncooperative hands. After a couple of floors she went in again to find a public data terminal in a ward that was too busy to notice her.<br> <br>They had not told her even the donor&#x2019;s name, and a straightforward voice request met a built-in resistance: DATA RESTRICTED***KEY IN PHYSICIAN IDENT CODE. So she asked the machine for the names of organ donors on contract with the regional Ministry of Health, then a list of the hospital&#x2019;s terminal neurological patients, the causes and projected times of their deaths, and the postmortem neurosurgeries scheduled for the next morning. And, finally, the names of patients about whom information was media-restricted. Teo&#x2019;s own name appeared on the last list. She should have been ready for this but found she was not, and she sat staring until the letters grew unfamiliar, assumed strange juxtapositions, became detached and meaningless&#x2014;the name of a stranger.<br> <br>The computer scanned and compared the lists for her, extrapolated from the known data, and delivered only one name. She did not ask for hard copy. She looked at the vid display a moment, and then punched it off and sat staring at the blank screen.<br> <br>Perhaps not consciously, she had expected a woman. The name, a man&#x2019;s name, threw her off balance a little. She would have liked a little time to get used to the sound of it, the sound it made in her head and on her lips. She would have liked to know the name before she knew the man. But he would be dead in the morning. So she spoke it once, only once, aloud, with exactness and with care. &#x201c;Dhavir Stahl,&#x201d; she said. And then went to a pneumo-tube and rode up.<br> <br>In the tube there were at first several others, finally only one. Not European, perhaps North African, a man with eyebrows in a thick straight line across a beetled brow. He watched her sidelong&#x2014;clearly recognized her&#x2014;and he wore a physician&#x2019;s ID badge. In a workplace as large as this one the rumor apparatus would be well established. He would know of her admission, maybe even the surgery that had been scheduled. Would, at the very least, see the incongruity of a VIP patient, street-dressed and unaccompanied, riding up in the public pneumo-tube. So Teo stood imperiously beside him with disobedient hands clasped together behind her back and eyes focused on the smooth center seam of the door while she waited for him to speak, or not. When the tube opened at the seventy-eighth floor he started out, then half turned toward her, made a stiff little bow, and said, &#x201c;Good health, Madame Minister,&#x201d; and finally exited. If he reported straightaway to security, she might have five minutes, or ten, before they reasoned out where she had gone. And standing alone now in the pneumo-tube, she began to feel the first sour leaking of despair&#x2014;what could be said, learned, shared in such little time?<br> <br>There was a vid map beside the portal on the ninety-first floor. She searched it until she found the room and the straightest route, then went quickly, gripping the handrail for support, along the endless corridors, past the little tableaux of sickness framed where a door here or there stood open, and finally to the designated room, a closed door.<br> <br>She would have waited. She wanted to wait, to gather up a few dangling threads, reweave a place or two that had lately worn through. But the physician in the pneumo-tube had stolen that possibility. So she took in a thin new breath and touched one wobbly thumb to the admit disk. The door opened, waited for her, closed behind her. She stood just inside, stood very straight, with her hands hanging open beside her thighs.<br> <br>The man whose name was Dhavir Stahl was fitting together the pieces of a masters-level holoplex, sitting on his bed, cross-legged under a light sheet, with the scaffolding of the puzzle in front of him on the bed table and its thousands of tiny elements jumbled around him on the sheets. He glanced at Teo from under the ledge of his eyebrows while he worked. He had that vaguely anxious quality all East Europeans seemed to carry about their eyes. But his mouth was good, a wide mouth with creases lapping around its corners&#x2014;creases where his smile would fit. And he worked silently, patiently.<br> <br>&#x201c;I would speak with you,&#x201d; Teo said.<br> <br>He was tolerant, even faintly apologetic. &#x201c;Did you look at the file, or just the door code? I&#x2019;ve already turned down offers from a priest and a psychiatrist and, this morning, somebody from narcotics. I just don&#x2019;t seem to need any deathbed comforting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Teo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is that? One of the research divisions?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My name.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mouth made nearly a smile, perhaps embarrassment, or puzzlement.<br> <br>&#x201c;They hadn&#x2019;t told you my name, then,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>And finally he took it in. His face seemed to tighten, all of it pulling back toward his scalp as the skin shrinks from the skull of a corpse, so that his mouth was too wide and there was no space left for smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;They seem to have a good many arbitrary rules,&#x201d; Teo said. &#x201c;They refused me this meeting, your name even. And you, mine, it appears. I could not&#x2014;I had a need to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>She waited raggedly through a very long silence. Her palms were faintly damp, but she continued to hold them open beside her legs. Finally Dhavir Stahl moved, straightened a little, perhaps took a breath. But his eyes stayed with Teo.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look healthy,&#x201d; he said. It seemed a question.<br> <br>She made a slight gesture with one shoulder, a sort of shrugging off. &#x201c;I have lost motor skills.&#x201d; And in a moment, because he continued to wait, she added, &#x201c;I am losing ability to walk. To use my hands. The cerebellum is evidently quite diseased. They first told me I would die. Then they said no, maybe not, and they sent me here.&#x201d;<br> <br>He had not moved his eyes from her. One of his hands lightly touched the framework of the puzzle as a blind man would touch a new face, but he never took his eyes from Teo. Finally she could not bear that, and her own eyes skipped out to the window to the dark sheets of rain flapping beneath the overcast.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are not what I expected,&#x201d; he said. When her eyes came round to him again, he made that near smile and forced air from his mouth&#x2014;not a laugh, a hard sound of bleak amusement. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask! God, I don&#x2019;t know what I expected.&#x201d; He let go the puzzle and looked away finally, looked down at his hands, then out to the blank vid screen on the wall, the aseptic toilet in the corner. When he lifted his face to her again, his eyes were very dark, very bright, she thought he might weep. But he said only, &#x201c;You are Asian.&#x201d; He was not quite asking it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pakistani?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nepalese.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded without surprise or interest. &#x201c;Do you climb?&#x201d;<br> <br>She lifted her shoulders again, shrugging. &#x201c;We are not all Sherpa bearers,&#x201d; she said with a prickly edge of impatience. There was no change at his mouth, but he fell silent and looked away from her. Belatedly she felt she might have shown more tolerance. Her head began to ache a little from a point at the base of the skull. She would have liked to knead the muscles along her shoulders. But she waited, standing erect and stiff and dismal, with her hands hanging, while the time they had together went away quickly and ill used.<br> <br>Dhavir Stahl raised his arms, made a loose, meaningless gesture in the air, then combed back his hair with the fingers of both hands. His hair and his hands seemed very fine. &#x201c;Why did you come?&#x201d; he said, and his eyelashes drew closed, shielding him as he spoke.<br> <br>There were answers that would have hurt him again. She sorted through for one that would not. &#x201c;To befriend you,&#x201d; she said, and saw his eyes open slowly. In a moment he sighed. It was a small sound, dry and sliding, the sound a bare foot makes in sand. He looked at the puzzle, touched an element lying loose on the bed, turned it round with a fingertip. And round.<br> <br>Without looking toward her, he said, &#x201c;Their computer has me dead at four-oh-seven-fourteen. They&#x2019;ve told you that, I guess. There&#x2019;s a two percent chance of miscalculation. Two or three, I forget. So anyway, by four thirty.&#x201d; His mouth was drawn out thin.<br> <br>She thought, You will not have time to finish your puzzle.<br> <br>She said, &#x201c;They would have given you another artificial heart.&#x201d;<br> <br>He lifted his face, nearly smiled again. &#x201c;They told you that? Yes. Another one. I wore out my own and one of theirs.&#x201d; He did not explain or justify. He simply raised his shoulders, perhaps shrugging, and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d; He was looking toward her, but his eyes saw only inward. She waited for him. Finally he stirred, turned his palms up, studied them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did they&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting a woman. Men and women move differently. I didn&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;d give a man&#x2019;s cerebellum to a woman.&#x201d; He glanced at Teo, taking her in, all of her. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re small. I&#x2019;m, what, twenty kilos heavier, half a meter taller? I&#x2019;d think you&#x2019;d have some trouble getting used to the way I move. Or anyway the way my brain tells my body to move.&#x201d; He was already looking at his hands again, rubbing them against each other with a slight papery sound.<br> <br>&#x201c;They told me I would adapt to it,&#x201d; Teo said. &#x201c;Or the new cerebellum could be retaught.&#x201d;<br> <br>His eyes skipped up to her as if she had startled or frightened him. His mouth moved too, sliding out wide to show the sharp edge of his teeth. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t tell me that,&#x201d; he said from a rigid grin.<br> <br>It was a moment before she was able to find a reason for his agitation. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t they said it wouldn&#x2019;t reduce the donor&#x2019;s sense of self.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a while, after quite a while, he said, &#x201c;What word did they use? They wouldn&#x2019;t have said &#x2018;reduce.&#x2019; Maybe &#x2018;correct&#x2019; or &#x2018;edit out.&#x2019;?&#x201d; His eyes slid sideways, away from her, then back again. His mouth was still tight, grimacing, shaping a smile that wasn&#x2019;t there. &#x201c;They were at least frank about it. They said the cerebellum only runs the automatic motor functions, the skilled body movements. They said they would have expected&#x2014;no, they said they would have liked&#x2014;a transplanted cerebellum to be mechanical. A part, like a lung or a kidney. The &#x2018;mind&#x2019; ought to be all in the forebrain. They told me there wouldn&#x2019;t be any donor consciousness, none at all, if they could figure out how to stop it.&#x201d;<br> <br>In a moment he was able to drop his eyes from Teo. He sat with his long, narrow hands cupped on his knees and stared at the scaffolding of his puzzle. She could hear his breath sliding in and out, a contained and careful sound. Finally he selected an element from among the thousands around him on the bed, turned it solemnly in his hands, turned it again, then reached to fit it into the puzzle, deftly finding a place for it among the multitude of interlocking pieces. He did not look at Teo, but in a moment he said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look scared. I&#x2019;d be scared if they were putting bits of somebody else inside my head.&#x201d; He slurred the words a little, and just at the end and jumped his eyes to her and away.<br> <br>She made a motion to open her hands, but then, irresistibly, turned her palms in, chafing harshly against her pants legs.<br> <br>She chose a word from among several possible. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Dhavir&#x2019;s eyes came up to her again with something like surprise. And then something like tenderness. The door behind Teo opened and three security people stepped inside, diminishing the size of the room with their small crowd, their turbulence. One of them extended her hand but did not quite touch Teo&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Minister Teo,&#x201d; she said. Formal. Irritated.<br> <br>Dhavir seemed not to register the formal address. Maybe he would remember it later, maybe not, and Teo thought probably it wouldn&#x2019;t matter. They watched each other silently, Teo standing carefully erect with her hands, the hands that no longer brushed teeth nor wrote cursive script, the hands she had learned to distrust, hanging open beside her thighs, and Dhavir sitting cross-legged amid his puzzle, with his forearms resting across his knees. Teo waited. The security person touched her elbow, beginning to draw her firmly toward the door. Her legs, her entire body, resisted this movement, whether from disability or from stubborn opposition she could not have said. Dhavir spoke her name. &#x201c;Teo,&#x201d; he said. She pulled her arm free and stiffened her spine to turn, to face him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I run lopsided,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Like a duck, I guess. &#x201c;I throw my toes out or something. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; His slight smile was wry, apologizing for something else.<br> <br>In a moment, she said, &#x201c;I scuff my feet on the ground when I walk. I haven&#x2019;t run in years. You and I, perhaps we will learn new ways, together.&#x201d; And with infinite, excruciating care, she lifted her palms to him as if holding out a gift.</p><h2>Nazi Psychoanalysis V1: Volume I: Only Psychoanalysis Won the War (Nazi Psychoanalysis (Paperback))</h2><p>Psychoanalysis was a symptom of everything the Nazis reviled: an intellectual assault on Kultur largely perpetrated by Jews. It was also, as this remarkable revisionary work shows, an inescapable symptom of modernity, practiced, transformed, and perpetuated by and within the Nazi regime. A sweeping, magisterial work by one of the most incisive and interesting scholars of modern philosophy, theory, and culture, Nazi Psychoanalysis studies the breadth of this phenomenon in order to clarify and deepen our understanding not only of psychoanalysis but of the twentieth century itself. <p>Tracing the intersections of psychoanalysis and Nazism, Laurence A. Rickels discovers startling conjunctions and continuities in writers as diverse as Adler and Adorno, Kafka and Goethe, Lacan, H. Rider Haggard, and Heidegger, and in works as different as Der Golem, Civilization and Its Discontents, Frankenstein, Faust, and Brave New World. In a richly allusive style, he writes of psychoanalysis in multifarious incarnations, of the concept and actual history of "insurance," of propaganda in theory and practice, of psychological warfare, Walt Disney, and the Frankfurt School debates-a dizzying tour of the twentieth century that helps us see how the "corridor wars" that arise in the course of theoretical, clinical, social, political, and cultural attempts to describe the human psyche are related to the world wars of the century in an intimate and infinitely complicated manner. </p><p>Though some have used its appropriation by the Nazis to brand psychoanalysis with the political odium of fascism, Rickels instead finds an uncanny convergence-one that suggests far-reaching possibilities for both psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism. His work, with its enormous intellectual and historical span, makes a persuasive argument that no element of modernity-not psychoanalysis any more than Marxism or deconstruction, cultural revolutions or technological advances-can be adequately understood without a thorough consideration of its Nazi component. </p><p>Laurence A. Rickels is professor of German and comparative literature at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Some of the story has been told piecemeal in a range of diverse books and articles, a few with extensive fleet lists; however, the complete history of the twentieth century wartime-built standard merchant ship has not previously been written, so this new volume recording that history within its appropriate technical, political, and military background will be hugely welcomed.The book includes ships built in Canada, Japan, Germany, and other countries.</p><p><b>NICK ROBINS</b>, a geologist by profession, is acknowledged for placing maritime history within the bigger social and political picture.

Following Bowie&#x2019;s life from his start as David Jones, an R &amp; B&#x2014;loving kid from Bromley, England, to his rise to rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll aristocracy as David Bowie, Bowie recounts his career but also reveals how much his music has influenced other musicians and forever changed the landscape of the modern era. Along the way, Spitz reflects on how growing up with Bowie as his soundtrack and how writing this definitive book on Bowie influenced him in ways he never expected, adding a personal dimension that Bowie fans and those passionate about art and culture will connect with and that no other bio on the artist offers. <br><br>Bowie takes an in-depth look at the culture of postwar England in which Bowie grew up, the mod and hippie scenes of swinging London in the sixties, the sex and drug-fueled glitter scene of the early seventies when Bowie&#x2019;s alter-ego Ziggy Stardust was born, his rise to global stardom in the eighties and his subsequent status as an elder statesman of alternative culture. Spitz puts each incarnation of Bowie into the context of its era, creating a cultural time line that is intriguing both for its historical significance as well as for its delineation of this rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll legend, the first musician to evolve a coherent vision after the death of the sixties dream. <br><br>Amid the sex, drugs and rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll mayhem, a deeper portrait of the artist emerges. Bowie&#x2019;s early struggles to go from follower to leader, his tricky relationship with art and commerce and Buddhism and the occult, his complicated family life, his open romantic relationship and, finally, his perceived disavowal of all that made him a touchstone for outcasts are all thoughtfully explored. A fresh evaluation of his recorded work, as well as his film, stage and video performances, is included as well. <br><br>Based on a hundred original interviews with those who knew him best and those familiar with his work, including ex-wife Angie Bowie, former Bowie manager Kenneth Pitt, Siouxsie Sioux, Camille Paglia, Dick Cavett, Todd Haynes, Ricky Gervais and Peter Frampton, Bowie gives us not only a portrait of one of the most important artists in the last century, but also an honest examination of a truly revolutionary artist and the unique impact he&#x2019;s had across generations.</p><p>MARC SPITZ&#x2019;s writing on rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll and popular culture has appeared in <i>Spin</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Maxim, Nylon, Blender</i> and <i>Uncut</i> (UK).

Punk</i>.1.<br><br>There's an alien in the window of the house next door to the one where David Bowie was born at 40 Stansfield Road in Brixton, a southern borough of London. It peers out, gray skinned, with black, oval-shaped eyes and a tennis-racket-sized skull, the same kind of inflatable spacemen for sale in the gas station gift shops that one stops at while driving through Roswell, New Mexico. X-Files/E.T.-faced aliens. It might not be there now, should you decide to make a new pilgrimage, but it was there when I traveled to Brixton, as if to say, "Welcome, biographer!"<br><br>Whoever lives in the virtually identical home at 38 Stansfield Road, they certainly know who was born next door. If the alien had eyelids it'd be winking. Otherwise, this block, like every other block in the area, is as quiet as it must have been in the harsh winter of 1947. The house itself is three stories high, pale brick, with a double-arched doorway painted French white. A chest-high brick wall separates the house from the adjacent buildings. Another brick wall girds the property, sectioning off a very tiny lawn and a spindled tree that extends just past the chimney. It's a handsome if compact residence. Unlike the city of Brixton, which was predominantly a white, middle-class enclave in the years just after World War II, this home is static. In another fifty-two years, while jet packs and flying cars travel overhead, one can imagine it looking exactly the same. There's no brass plaque here marking David Bowie's birth, but it is, nonetheless, a landmark, one pristinely preserved whether by design, accident or simple lack of means or inclination. That he came into the world inside is hardly unique; many children in the late forties were born at home and not in a hospital. Midwives were summoned once the water broke, as one would call a plumber or policeman. The house's real significance has less to do with David Bowie's and more to do with his mother and father's story anyhow. This was a second-chance home, the place where they hoped to build a strong family unit after their dark and complicated childhoods and some false starting on either side with regard to romance and parenthood. Brixton was still in wreckage thanks to the Nazi buzz bombs and the depleted nation's inability to quickly rebuild when David's mother, Margaret Mary Burns, from Royal Tunbridge Wells in the county of Kent, met his father, Haywood Stenton Jones, from Doncaster, Yorkshire. She was known as Peggy and he as John. It was not a posh area but it was theirs, a place to create new memories and remain protected from the area pain they'd known.<br><br>Of the two, Peggy had the most to distance herself from. Several incidents occurred in her teens and early twenties that could cumulatively take on the characteristics of a Burns family curse. Mental illness seemed to be seared deeply into the genetic code (as has been well documented by other biographers and commented on by Bowie himself) David spent much of his adult life wondering when, not if, he was going to go legitimately mad. Schizophrenic behavior can lay dormant until triggered by a cataclysmic event. For Peggy, her three sisters and her brother, this event was of course the Second World War. However, Nora Burns, the second child, and Vivienne, the fifth, began exhibiting signs of mental illness early on. The constant explosions of the Luftwaffe's missiles and the nightmarish prospect of the Nazis occupying the United Kingdom coupled with the heartbreak of falling in love with a series of noncommittal soldiers would push their tendencies into full-blown afflictions during the war years. The disease manifested itself mostly as irrational behavior--nonsensical comments, unkempt appearance, chain-smoking, promiscuity, extreme passivity--so it can be argued, given the seemingly domino-like effect it had on the Burns girls, that schizophrenia itself was another, if quieter, cataclysmic event. Peggy's father, Jimmy, was a professional soldier of modest means, and the home they shared on Meadow Lane was close-quartered enough to amplify any breach in acceptable social behavior. Certain studies do indicate that those with schizophrenic brothers and sisters are more likely to exhibit schizophrenic tendencies themselves. Someone with one schizophrenic parent is even more likely to develop the disease. Peggy ultimately exhibited behavior that might be considered borderline. She could be loud, theatrical, and act out. She was basically spared the full effects of the illness, possibly because it was not actually something that was inherited but rather a very, very sad coincidence within this one English family. Still, it was certainly a specter, and so, at age twenty-two, Peggy, the oldest, became the first Burns sibling to leave the house. She found work as a resident nanny for guests of a nearby hotel, the Culverden Park Arms. It was during this period that she had a well-documented but exceedingly brief dalliance with the Blackshirts, a faction of nationalists headed by a Parliament member named Oswald Mosley ("Mister Oswald with the swastika tattoo," in Elvis Costello's debut single "Less Than Zero"). Much has been made of this in other Bowie biographies, given David Bowie's also well-covered fascination with fascism four decades later in the mid-1970s. One need not be an apologist (or superfan) to see how Bowie's publicly stated and since recanted endorsement of Hitler's charisma and the merits of a fascist leader overtaking Britain, while speaking with Cameron Crowe in a notorious 1976 Playboy interview, was the product of cocaine psychosis rather than any real fidelity to notions of racial purity or governmental insurrection. Peggy's attraction (leading to a fleeting attendance of one rally) was, it's been said, even less substantial in its motivation. It was the actual black shirts, those sleek and slimming namesakes, that attracted her rather than loudly spat polemics against immigration and integration.<br><br>Relationships started during wartime are often more passionate than those begun during peace and prosperity. Peggy, with her high forehead, elegant nose, pale skin and dark, humorous eyes, possessed a certain unconventional, very English beauty. Although willful and independent, she was not immune to the rush of untethered emotion that seemed to wash over her generation with the declaration of war. While working at the hotel, she began a relationship with an employee, a handsome Jewish Frenchman named Wolf Rosemberg (who called himself Jack). He worked as a porter in the bar. His father was a well-off fur dealer in Paris. Their affair began in secret in the spring of 1937. She believed that she had met the love of her life. Soon afterward, she learned that she was pregnant. Rosemberg proposed. Their first and only child, Terence Guy Adair Burns, was born in the local Pembury Hospital on November 5, Guy Fawkes Day (hence his middle name). Adair was a family name. Everyone called the baby Terry.<br><br>Jack and Peggy would never marry, and Terry would never really know his biological father. Early in 1938, the Nazis began annexing Eastern Europe and eventually invaded France. Jack returned to his family and joined up with the Resistance. He reappeared in London shortly before bombs began falling on Great Britain in '39. Jack attempted to claim the baby but was rebuffed by Peggy's mother, Margaret, as Peggy wasn't at home at the time. Rather than waiting, Rosemberg disappeared, his impatience and urgency surely affected by the pervasive communal feelings of impending doom fast engulfing all of free Europe.<br><br>Distraught, Peggy, like many young British and American women, went to work in a munitions factory. She raised Terry with Margaret's help. Peggy then entered into a rebound affair with a factory coworker. This led to another pregnancy, this time a daughter. Unable to care for both children on her own, she gave the child over to foster care when she was three months old and continued to make bombs and nurse her broken heart. In many ways, Peggy never got over Jack Rosemberg. He was "the one that got away," and this sentiment would foment a resentment that would compromise the peace and optimism of Peggy and John's second-chance home on Stansfield Road (especially after Terry grew into a ringer for his estranged biological father).<br><br>Compared with the Burns family, David's father was from relatively stolid genetic stock. John's influence surely had a calming, even a saving effect, on Peggy and David in both the postwar years as well as the increasingly chaotic 1960s, when David rebelled against his class and station and struggled to find success as a singer and songwriter. John's father, Robert Haywood Jones, was a boot maker, and his mother, Zillah Hannah Jones, worked in an industrial wool mill. She died when he was very young. John was sent away to private school and like many British children of his age, he was subjected to a brutally strict rearing full of emotional suppression and harsh punishment for dissent. As a young man, he lost his crippling shyness in the dark of the local cinema. Jones, whose features in photos seem much more pinched than those of Peggy, as if he's constantly straining to avoid saying something troubling or rebellious, became a great fan of escapist films, English music halls, American jazz--anything that temporarily relieved him of his painful diffidence. When his father passed away John inherited a trust of three thousand pounds, to be paid out on the day of his twenty-first birthday in the fall of 1933. Jones decided to parlay the funds into a career in the entertainment business and some kind of permanent relief from his painfully quiet life. He left Yorkshire for London and fell under the wing of a fast-talking Irish would-be music hall impresario named James Sullivan.<br><br>Sullivan was married to a mysterious Italian performer who was said to have perished before a live audience during a circus stunt gone wrong.

Addressed to admirers and enemies alike, including Adlai Stevenson, Justice William Douglas, Dwight Eisenhower, Joe McCarthy, and Truman's wife, Bess, these intriguing letters cover such diverse subjects as the atomic bomb, running the country, and human greed.</p></p><p>About the Editor<p>Monte M.

Truman versus the Medical Lobby and Letters Home by Harry Truman.</p><p>"<i>Strictly Personal and Confidential</i> offers a unique look at a man reacting naturally to enormous pressures. Truman often had second, more prudent thoughts about what he called his 'spasms.' Sometimes he would scribble furiously and then stuff the result into his desk while he cooled off; on other occasions, he dictated blisterers to Rose Conway, his longtime personal secretary, and then returned the typescript with a diplomatic directive: 'Rose, file it. H.S.T.' In either case, he left behind a trail of entertaining and often fascinating documents, a short history of the frustrations of power, written at white heat."&#x2014;<i>Time</i></p><br><br><p>"The letters are in the spirit of 'giving them hell,' the bulldog approach that gave Truman his upset presidential election victory in 1948. They will not change the course of history, nor alter our perception of the man; but they will reinforce our feelings for a president who had grit and the not inconsiderable virtue of candor."&#x2014;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p></p><h2>Learning English with the Bible: Answer Guide</h2><p>Learning English with the Bible Answer Guide serves as a tool to assist English teachers who are using the Learning English with the Bible Textbook as their English grammar curriculum.</p><p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Ireland</h2><p><p><b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Ireland</i></b> is your in-depth guide to the very best of Ireland.</p><p>From touring historic castles to exploring the countryside along the mystical Ring of Kerry to drinking Guinness in Dublin's coziest pub, experience the best of what the Emerald Isle has to offer.</p><p>Discover <b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Ireland</i></b>.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Detailed itineraries and "don't-miss" destination highlights at a glance. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Illustrated cutaway 3-D drawings of important sights. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Floor plans and guided visitor information for major museums. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Guided walking tours, local drink and dining specialties to try, things to do, and places to eat, drink, and shop by area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Area maps marked with sights. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Detailed city map of Dublin includes street finder index for easy navigation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Insights into history and culture to help you understand the stories behind the sights. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Hotel and restaurant listings highlight DK Choice special recommendations. <br><p>With hundreds of full-color photographs, hand-drawn illustrations, and custom maps that illuminate every page, <b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Ireland</i></b> truly shows you what others only tell you.</p><p>Recommended: For an in-depth guidebook to Dublin, check out <b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Dublin</i></b>, which offers the most complete coverage of Ireland's capital city, trip-planning itineraries, and more.</p><p><b>Series Overview:</b> For more than two decades, DK Eyewitness Travel Guides have helped travelers experience the world through the history, art, architecture, and culture of their destinations.

Not only was only was their romance wildly passionate but they were also probably the most successful political partnership of all, outstripping Antony and Cleopatra or Napoleon and Josephine. Their secret letters, which discuss other lovers, sex, wars, politics, arts and health, are surely the most intimate and extraordinary ever written by an empress or politician. Both characters in this joint biography, based on new archives, are fascinating: she a German princess married lovelessly at 14 to the Russian heir combined charm, passion and political genius. She ruthlessly seized power and ruled triumphantly for thirty years; he - a brilliant flamboyant politician, strategist and conqueror of wild eccentricity and debauchery. Outrageously sexual and political, he was the love of her life. They shocked Europe by taking younger lovers yet they secretly married and ruled together as best friends, and lifelong lovers.</p><p>Simon Sebag Montefiore is a prizewinning historian whose bestselling books have been published in over forty languages.

It was a strange place for the procession of a great man to rest: there was no tavern in sight, not even a peasant's hovel. The big sleeping carriage, pulled by eight horses, halted first. The others - there were probably four in all - slowed down and stopped alongside the first on the grass as the footmen and cavalry escort ran to see what was happening. The passengers threw open their carriage doors. When they heard the despair in their master's voice, they hurried towards his carriage.<br><br>`That's enough!' said Prince Potemkin. `That's enough! There is no point in going on now.' Inside the sleeping carriage, there were three harassed doctors and a slim countess with high cheekbones and auburn hair, all crowded round the Prince. He was sweating and groaning. The doctors summoned the Cossacks to move their massive patient. `Take me out of the carriage...' Potemkin ordered. Everyone jumped when he commanded, and he had commanded virtually everything in Russia for a long time. Cossacks and generals gathered round the open door and slowly, gently began to bear out the stricken giant.<br><br>The Countess accompanied him out of the carriage, holding his hand, dabbing his hot brow as tears streamed down her face with its small retrousse nose and full mouth. A couple of p0Moldavian peasants who tended cattle on the nearby steppe ambled over to watch. His bare feet came first, then his legs and his half-open dressing gown - though this vision in itself was not unusual. Potemkin notoriously greeted empresses and ambassadors in bare feet and open dressing gowns. But now it was different. He still had the leonine Slavic handsomeness, the thick head of hair, once regarded as the finest in the Empire, and the sensual Grecian profile that had won him the nickname 'Alcibiades" as a young man. However, his hair was now flecked with grey and hung over his feverish forehead. He was still gigantic in stature and breadth. Everything about him was exaggerated, colossal and original, but his life of reckless indulgence and relentless ambition had bloated his body and aged his face. Like a Cyclops he had only one eye; the other was blind and damaged, giving him the appearance of a pirate. His chest was broad and hairy. Always a force of nature, he now resembled nothing so much as a magnificent animal reduced to this twitching, shivering pile of flesh.<br><br>The apparition on this wild steppe was His Most Serene Highness Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Grigory Alexandrovich Potemkin, probably husband of the Empress of Russia, Catherine the Great, and certainly the love of her life, the best friend of the woman, the co-ruler of her Empire and the partner in her dreams. He was Prince of Taurida, Field-Marshal, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, Grand Herman of the Black Sea and Ekaterinoslav Cossacks, Grand Admiral of the Black Sea and Caspian Fleets, President of the College of War, viceroy of the south, and possibly the next King of Poland, or of some other principality of his own making.<br><br>The Prince, or Serenissimus, as he was known across the Russian Empire, had ruled with Catherine 11 for nearly two decades. They had known each other for thirty years and had shared each other's lives for almost twenty. Beyond that, the Prince defied, and still defies, all categorization. Catherine noticed him as a witty young man and summoned him to be her lover at a time of crisis. When their affair ended, he remained her friend, partner and minister and became her co-Tsar. She always feared, respected and loved him - but their relationship was stormy. She called him her `Colossus', and her `tiger', her `idol', `hero', the `greatest eccentric'.' This was the `genius" who hugely increased her Empire, created Russia's Black Sea Fleet, conquered the Crimea, won the Second Turkish War and founded famed cities such as Sebastopol and Odessa. Russia had not possessed an imperial statesman of such success in both dreams and deeds since Peter the Great.<br><br>Serenissimus made his own policies - sometimes inspired, sometimes quixotic - and constructed his own world. While his power depended on his partnership with Catherine, he thought and behaved like one of the sovereign powers of Europe. Potemkin dazzled its Cabinets and Courts with his titanic achievements, erudite knowledge and exquisite taste, while simultaneously scandalizing them with his arrogance and debauchery, indolence and luxury. While hating him for his power and inconsistency, even his enemies acclaimed his intelligence and creativity.<br>Now this barefoot Prince half staggered - and was half carried by his Cossacks across the grass. This was a remote and spectacular spot, not even on the main road between Jassy, in today's Rumania, and Kishnev, in today's Republic of Moldova. In those days, this was the territory of the Ottoman Sultan, conquered by Potemkin. Even today it is hard to find, but in 200 years it has hardly changed. The spot where they laid Potemkin was a little plateau beside a steep stone lane whence one could see far in every direction. The countryside to the right was a rolling green valley rising in a multitude of green, bushy mounds into the distance, covered in the now almost vanished high grass of the steppes. To the left, forested hills fell away into the mist. Straight ahead, Potemkin's entourage would have seen the lane go down and then rise up a higher hill covered in dark. trees and thick bushes, disappearing down the valley. Potemkin, who loved to drive his carriage at night through the rain,' had called a stop in a place of the wildest and most beautiful natural drama.'<br><br>His entourage could only have added to it. The confection of the exotic and the civilized in Potemkin's companions that day reflected his contradictions: `Prince Potemkin is the emblem of the immense Russian Empire,' wrote the Prince de Ligne, who knew him well, `he too is composed of deserts and goldmines.'' His Court - for he was almost royal, though Catherine teasingly called it his `bassecour', halfway between a royal court and a farmyard' emerged on to the steppe.<br><br>Many of his attendants were already weeping. The Countess, the only woman present, wore the long-sleeved flowing Russian robes favoured by her friend the Empress, but her stockings and shoes were the finest of French fashion, ordered from Paris by Serenissimus himself. Her travelling jewellery was made up of priceless diamonds from Potemkin's unrivalled collection. Then there were generals and counts in tailcoats and uniforms with sashes and medals and tricorn hats that would not have been remarkable at Horse-Guards in London or any eighteenth-century court, but there was also a sprinkling of Cossack atamans, Oriental princelings, Moldavian boyars, renegade Ottoman pashas, servants, clerks, common soldiers - and the bishops, rabbis, fakirs and mullahs whose company Potemkin most enjoyed. Nothing relaxed him as much as a discussion on Byzantine theology, the customs of some Eastern tribe such as the Bashkirs, or Palladian architecture, Dutch painting, Italian music, English Gardens . . .<br>li0The bishops sported the flowing robes of Orthodoxy, the rabbis the tangled ringlets of Judaism, the Ottoman renegades the turbans, pantaloons and slippers of the Sublime Porte. The Moldavians, Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Sultan, wore bejewelled kaftans and high hats encircled with fur and encrusted with rubies, the ordinary Russian soldiers the 'Potemkin' hats, coats, soft boots and buckskin trousers designed for their ease by the Prince himself. Lastly the Cossacks, most of them Boat Cossacks known as Zaporogians, had fierce moustaches and shaven heads except for a tuft on top leading down the back in a long ponytail, like characters from Last o f the Mohicans, and brandished short curved daggers, engraved pistols and their special long lances. They watched sadly, for Potemkin adored the Cossacks.<br><br>The woman was Potemkin's shrewd and haughty niece, Countess Alexandra Branicka, aged thirty-seven and a formidable political force in her own right. Potemkin's love affairs with the Empress and a brazen parade of noblewomen and courtesans had shocked even French courtiers who remembered Louis XV's Versailles. Had he really made all five of his legendarily beautiful nieces into his mistresses? Did he love Countess Branicka the most of all?<br><br>The Countess ordered them to place a rich Persian rug on the grass. Then she let them lower Prince Potemkin gently on to it. `I want to die in the field,' he said as they settled him there. He had spent the previous fifteen years travelling as fast across Russia's vastness as any man in the eighteenth century: `a trail of sparks marks his swift journey', wrote the poet Gavrili Derzhavin in his ode to Potemkin, The Waterfall. So, appropriately for a man of perpetual movement, who barely lived in his innumerable palaces, Serenissimus added that he did not want to die in a carriage.y He wanted to sleep out on the steppe.<br><br>That morning, Potemkin asked his beloved Cossacks to build him a makeshift tent of their lances, covered with blankets and furs. It was a characteristically Potemkinian idea, as if the purity of a little Cossack camp would cure him of all his suffering.<br><br>The anxious doctors, a Frenchman and two Russians, gathered round the prone Prince and the attentive Countess, but there was little they could do. Catherine and Potemkin thought doctors made better players at the card table than healers at the bedside. The Empress joked that her Scottish doctor finished off most of his patients with his habitual panacea for every ailment a weakening barrage of emetics and bleedings. The doctors were afraid that they would be blamed if the Prince perished, because accusations of poisoning were frequently whispered at the Russian Court. Yet the eccentric Potemkin had been a thoroughly uncooperative patient, opening all the windows, having eau-de-Cologne poured on his head, consuming whole salted geese from Hamburg with gallons of wine - and now setting off on this tormented journey across the steppes.<br><br>The Prince was dressed in a rich silk dressing gown, lined with fur, sent to him days earlier by the Empress all the way from distant St Petersburg, almost two thousand versts. Its inside pockets bulged with bundles of the Empress's secret letters in which she consulted her partner, gossiped with her friend and decided the policies of her Empire. She destroyed most of his letters, but we are grateful that he romantically kept many of hers in that sentimental pocket next to his heart.<br><br>Twenty years of these letters reveal an equal and amazingly successful partnership of two statesmen and lovers that was startling in its modernity, touching in its ordinary intimacy and impressive in its statecraft. Their love affair and political alliance was unequalled in history by Antony and Cleopatra, Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, Napoleon and Josephine, because it was as remarkable for its achievements as for its romance, as endearing for its humanity as for its power. Like everything to do with Potemkin, his life with Catherine was crisscrossed with mysteries: were they secretly married? Did they conceive a child together? Did they really share power? Is it true that they agreed to remain partners while indulging themselves with a string of other lovers? Did Potemkin pimp for the Empress, procuring her young favourites, and did she help him seduce his nieces and turn the Imperial Palace into his own family harem?<br><br>As his illness ebbed and flowed, his travels were pursued by Catherine's caring, wifely notes, as she sent dressing gowns and fur coats for him to wear, scolded him for eating too much or not taking his medicines, begged him to rest and recover, and prayed to God not to take her beloved. He wept as he read them.<br><br>At this very moment, the Empress's couriers were galloping in two directions across Russia, changing their exhausted horses at imperial post-houses. They came from St Petersburg, bearing Catherine's latest letter to the Prince, and from here in Moldavia they bore his latest to her. It had been so for a long time - and they were always longing to receive the freshest news of the other. But now the letters were sadder.<br><br>`My dear friend, Prince Grigory Alexandrovich,' she wrote on 3 October, `I received your letters of the 25th and 27th today a few hours ago and I confess that I am extremely worried by them .. . I pray God that He gives health back to you soon.' She was not worried when she wrote this, because it usually took ten days for letters to reach the capital from the south, though it could be done in seven, hell for leather. Ten days before, Potemkin appeared to have recovered - hence Catherine's calmness. But a few days earlier on 30 September, before his health seemed to improve, her letters were almost frantic. `My worry about your sickness knows no bounds,' she had written. `For Christ's sake, if necessary, take whatever the doctors think might ease your condition. I beg God to give you your energy and health back as soon as possible. Goodbye my friend ... I'm sending you a fur coat ...'. This was just sound and fury - for, while the coat was sent on earlier, neither of the letters reached him in time.<br><br>Somewhere in the 2,000 versts that separated the two of them, the couriers must have crossed paths. Catherine would not have been so optimistic if she had read Potemkin's letter, written on 4 October, the day before, as he set out. `Matushka [Little Mother] Most Merciful Lady,' he dictated to his secretary, `I have no energy left to suffer my torments. The only escape is to leave this town and I have ordered them to carry me to Nikolaev. I do not know what will become of me. Most faithful and grateful subject.' This was written in the secretary's hand but pathetically, at the bottom of the letter, Potemkin scrawled in a weak, angular and jumping hand: `The only escape is to leave.' It was unsigned.<br><br>The last batch of Catherine's letters to reach him had arrived the day before in the pouch of Potemkin's fastest courier, Brigadier Bauer, the devoted adjutant whom he often sent galloping to Paris to bring back silk stockings, to Astrakhan for sterlet soup, to Petersburg for oysters, to Moscow to bring back a dancer or a chessplayer, to Milan for a sheet of music, a virtuoso violinist or a wagon of perfumes. So often and so far had Bauer travelled on Potemkin's whim that he jokingly requested this for his epitaph: `Cy git Bauer sous ce rocher, Fouette, cocher!' ('Here lies Bauer under this stone, Coachman, drive on.!'<br><br>As they gathered round him on the steppe, the officials and courtiers would have reflected on the implications of this scene .for Europe, for their Empress, for the unfinished war with the Turks, for the possibilities of action against revolutionary France and defiant Poland. Potemkin's armies and fleets had conquered huge tracts of Ottoman territory around the Black Sea and in today's Rumania: now the Sultan's Grand Vizier hoped to negotiate a peace with him. The Courts of Europe from the port-sodden young First Lord of the Treasury, William Pitt, in Lon...</p><h2>Elia Kazan: A life</h2><p>The noted stage and film director and novelist recounts his long, eventful life--from Turkish boyhood to American success--and his career, sharing his experiences with other stage and screen notables</p><p>One of the most important theater autobiographies of the 1980s, <i>Elia Kazan: A Life</i>, has finally been released in paperback. The extra decade adds to the book's poignancy and its value: a history of backstage personalities and politics in the 20th century is included in this release. Elia Kazan was a founding member of the Group Theatre, was among those shouting "Strike! Strike!" on the legendary opening night of <i>Waiting for Lefty</i>, directed the two greatest Broadway dramas ever--<i>Death of the Salesman</i> and <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>--and earned countless other credits, but he also played a flawed role in the greatest real-life moral drama of his era: the McCarthy Communist witch hunts of the 1950s. Kazan offered names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. He cut his conscience to fit the fashion of the time, and his conscience continues to bleed. Though this book is framed, like so much of Kazan's best stage and film work, as a lifelong search for man's proper relationship to society, the book serves as a massive explanation and apologia for Kazan's one monumental lapse. He lived his life intensely, a life in which a single word could transform you, where a misdeed might be "never forgotten or forgiven." Such were the times, and Kazan captures them with appropriate drama.<b>Elia Kazan's</b> work includes stage productions of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman,</i> and <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> as well as films like <i>On the Waterfront, East of Eden</i>, and <i>Splendor in the Grass</i>. He is also the author of <i>The Arrangement, America America,</i> and <i>The Assassins</i>, among others.</p><h2>Secrets (Sweet Valley High #2)</h2><p>Beautiful and ruthless, Jessica Wakefield is determined to be chosen queen of the fall dance at Sweet Valley High.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she can win the contest, she's sure to win Bruce Patman, the most sought after boy in school.<br>The only person standing in Jessica's way is Enid Rollins.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jessica discovers the truth about Enid's past, she knows the crown is within her grasp.&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't care that Enid is her twin sister Elizabeth's best friend--or that revealing the secret may cost Enid both her reputation and the boy she loves.<br>Only Elizabeth can save Enid from Jessica's vicious gossip--but can she stop her scheming twin in time?</p><p></p><h2>The Bitter Taste of Victory: Life, Love and Art in the Ruins of the Reich</h2><p><p>When Germany surrendered in May 1945 it was a nation reduced to rubble. Immediately, America, Britain, Soviet Russia, and France set about rebuilding in their zones of occupation. Most urgent were physical needs--food, water, and sanitation--but from the start the Allies were also anxious to indoctrinate the German people in the ideas of peace and civilization. </p><p>Denazification and reeducation would be key to future peace, and the arts were crucial guides to alternative, less militaristic ways of life. In an extraordinary extension of diplomacy, over the next four years, many writers, artists, actors, and filmmakers were dispatched by Britain and America to help rebuild the country their governments had spent years bombing. Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn, Marlene Dietrich, George Orwell, Lee Miller, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Billy Wilder, and others undertook the challenge of reconfiguring German society. In the end, many of them became disillusioned by the contrast between the destruction they were witnessing and the cool politics of reconstruction.</p><p>While they may have had less effect on Germany than Germany had on them, the experiences of these celebrated figures, never before told, offer an entirely fresh view of post-war Europe. <i>The Bitter Taste of Victory</i> is a brilliant and important addition to the literature of World War II.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Lara Feigel </b>is a Senior Lecturer in English at King's College London, where her research centers on the 1930s and World War II.

Were there any &#x2018;good&#x2019; Germans? What could be reclaimed and renewed out of the rubble?

Feigel is excellent at defining the moral and intellectual distinctions between this group and other writers and filmmakers who were both more forgiving and more hopeful of German redemption . . . .

For military cops in Korea, drive-by shootings, flesh peddler's drug rings--they're all in a day's work. But nothing prepared them for the slickest criminals this side of the DMZ.<br><br>The Slicky Boys were everywhere. They could kill a man a thousand ways you don't even want to know about. And you'll never hear them coming.<br><br>The Slicky Boys steal, they kill, they slip away. And George and Ernie are about to discover that even the U.S. military is no match for evil, and that human sympathy can sometimes lead to a lonely grave.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>This thriller by a retired army officer has many things going for it: two very well-drawn central characters who are U.S. military police based in Seoul; a large cast of colorful secondary characters; some lively and inventive plot twists; and a setting--South Korea in 1975, 20 years after the Korean War--quickly brought to vivid life. George Sueno, the brains of the two-man Army CID team, grew up in foster homes in East Los Angeles, learned Korean quickly, and isn&#39;t nearly as baffled by the complexity of Korean customs as most of his fellow soldiers. His partner, Ernie Bascom, found a home in the Army better than the one he&#39;d left in Detroit to go to Vietnam; he&#39;s a blaze of mad action and sexual energy. They make an excellent team, bringing back memories of Chester Himes&#39;s Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson--two cops who also bent the rules to get results.<p>"Colorful...There's atmosphere to spare here, and enough suspense toplease, as [Limn] assembles a cast of unusual folk and sets them spinningamidst the complexities of an occupied and divided land."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Gritty, gripping....Made memorable by dashes of local color as pungentas kimchee."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>Praise for Martin Limn's <i>Jade Lady Burning</i>:</p><p>"It is not often that so impressive a debut as <i>Jade Lady Burning</i> appears....Searing in its intensity."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"An extraordinary book."<br>--<i>The Washington Times</i></p><p>"Its heroes...are two of the more memorable sleuths in the modernmystery canon....As gripping as it is disturbing."<br>--<i>The Plain Dealer</i>, Cleveland</p><p>"One of the most original concepts for a mystery yarn to emerge inrecent memory."<br>--<i>Booklist</i> Copyright � 1997 by Martin Lim�n.</p><p></p></p><h2>Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play</h2><p>Analyzes the music of Frank Zappa, discusses his creative process, and examines his cultural influence</p><p>There is probably no figure of modern popular music who so deserves the sort of scholarly exercise undertaken by Ben Watson in this book, and I am personally convinced that Zappa will be regaled by 21st Century music historians as a "crux of the biscuit" of 20th Century music. <p> And this 700 page tome will certainly be cited by our music historian descendants. In fairness, it may confound today's Zappa fans with it's copious references to Adorno, Freud, and Marx, but is likely to delight the erudite with its excerpts of the playfully situationist lyrics of Zappa, completely deconstructed by Watson. There is no doubt that Zappa was a genius--albeit a peculiarly American sort--and there is no doubt that no book has yet attempted such a thorough (albeit peculiar) analysis of his genius. Highly Recommended.</p>Ben Watson has written extensively on Frank Zappa. In 1993 he read his work - his &#39;demented scholarship&#39; to his dying hero.</p><h2>Fletch&#39;s Moxie</h2><p>In <b>Fletch&#x2019;s Moxie</b>, the prolific Gregory Mcdonald tests his incomparable investigative journalist once again with a caper that is as perfectly plotted as Fletch is brilliant. <br><br>It seems just about everyone in Hollywood had a reason to want Steve Peterman dead. But how someone managed to put a knife in his back on a live broadcast without being seen is anyone&#x2019;s guess. Unfortunately for Fletch, his girlfriend, Moxie Mooney, a huge star at the box office, is also the number one suspect. With the police asking way too many questions, Fletch whisks Moxie and her drunken father, O.L., off to Key West for a little privacy. But before he can even check out the beach, the rest of the suspects decide to check in. Now, in a house full of Hollywood&#x2019;s elite, Fletch is increasingly amazed at how ruthless the movie business can be.</p><p>Gregory Mcdonald is the author of twenty-six books, including eleven Fletch novels and four Flynn mysteries. He has twice won the Mystery Writers of America&#x2019;s prestigious Edgar Allen Poe Award for Best Mystery Novel, and was the first author to win for both a novel and its sequel. He died in 2008.1<br>"What happened to Steve?" The woman in the canvas chair leaned forward. She had not looked around from the television screen since Fletch entered the pavillion. No one else was there. She was speaking to herself, or to the air. "For God's sake, what's wrong?" she said in a tight, low voice.<br>Even under the canopy on a sunless day, the screen of the television monitor was blanched by daylight from the beach.<br>From where Fletch was standing, he could see the pale images flickering on the screen. Across a few meters of beach, between the cameras, standing lights, reflectors, and sound booms, he could see the reality of what was on the screen, the set of The Dan Buckley Show, host and guests.<br>In the middle chair sat Dan Buckley wearing white trousers, loafers, and a light blue Palm Beach shirt. Even at a distance, amiability seemed stuck on his face like a decal. To his left, in a long, white bulky dressing gown sat Moxie Mooney--the gorgeous, perky, healthy, fresh-faced young film star called away from her make-up table to oblige an on location talk show. To Buckley's right sat Moxie's agent, manager, and executive producer, Steve Peterman in three-piece, pearl-gray suit, black shoes, and cravat.<br>Only Steve Peterman wasn't sitting properly in his chair. He was slumped sideways. His head was on his right shoulder.<br>Fletch looked at his watch.<br>At the back of the talk-show set a heavy, brightly colored, split curtain moved slightly in the breeze. Behind the set, down the beach the Gulf of Mexico was gray-blue in that light. On all sides of the set was the paraphernalia of a much bigger set, the location of the film-in-progress, Midsummer Night's Madness, starring Moxie Mooney and Gerry Littleford. Odd-shaped trailers were parked on the beach, each facing a different direction, as if dropped there. False palm-thatched huts were here and there. Thick black cables ran every which way over the sand. Low wooden platforms, like portable dance floors, were tilted on the beach. Strewn everywhere were the odd-shaped light rigs, reflectors, cameras, and sound cranes. The whole beach looked like a sandbox of toys abandoned by a giant, rich child. Among all these trappings moved the film crew of Midsummer Night's Madness, working, apparently oblivious of the taping going on in their midst.<br>"What happened?" the woman repeated in a hoarse whisper.<br>Fletch put his glass of orange juice back on the bar table. He stood quietly behind the woman in her canvas chair. She still hadn't looked around at him.<br>Closer, he could see the monitor more clearly. In a loose head-shot, Moxie was alone on screen, laughing. Then she looked to her right, as if seeking confirmation from Steve Peterman, as if turning the conversation over to him. Moxie stopped talking with a short, sharp inhale. Laughter left her face. One eyebrow rose.<br>The camera pulled back to include Buckley. He looked to his right, to see what had surprised Moxie. His eyes widened. His lips did not move.<br>The camera pulled back farther. Steve Peterman's eyes stared blankly into the camera. His head was at such an odd angle resting on his shoulder his neck seemed broken. Blood oozed from the lower, right corner of his mouth. It dribbled down his cheek past his ear and onto his cravat.<br>In the pavillion, the woman in the canvas chair screamed. She stood up. She screamed again. People everywhere on the beach, even on the talkshow set, were looking at her. She clasped her hands over her mouth.<br>Fletch took her arm. Gently, firmly, he turned her body toward him. Her eyes were affixed to the monitor.<br>"Come on," he said. "Time for a break."<br>"What's happening? What happened to Steve?"<br>"Coffee," he said. "They'll be right back." <br>He turned her away from the reality of what was happening on the set and away from the unreality of what was happening focused on the television screen.<br>"Steve!" she called.<br>He made her walk. She stumbled against the canvas chair. He pushed it out of her way with his bare foot.<br>"Come on," he said. "Let's see what the canteen has to offer."<br>"But, Steve.. ." she said.<br>She put her hands over her face. He put his arm around her shoulder and guided her along.<br>He walked with her off the pavillion and up the beach to the flat, hard-packed parking lot. There were many trailers parked there.<br>In a reasonable tone of voice Fletch said, "I don't think there's anything you can do just now."<br>2<br>"Is Steve Peterman your husband?" Fletch asked. He was careful to use the word is rather than was although he was sure the latter was appropriate.<br>In the metal folding chair, her drawn face nodded in the affirmative. "I'm Marge Peterman."<br>Fletch had found two metal chairs and placed them behind a trailer in the parking lot, out of the way of the traffic he knew would be passing to and from the beach. He sat Marge Peterman in one and went to the canteen. He brought back two cups of coffee, one black, the other with cream and sugar. He offered her both. She chose the black. He put the other coffee on the sand near her feet, and sat quietly in the other chair.<br>Fletch had arrived at the location of Midsummer Night's Madness on Bonita Beach only a half hour before. His credentials from Global Cable News had gained him entry onto location. The security guard told him Moxie was taping The Dan Buckley Show and enjoined Fletch to silence. He directed Fletch to the hospitality pavillion where a courtesy bar had been set up to host the television crew and other press after the taping.<br>There he had found a woman sitting alone on a canvas chair watching her husband on a television monitor.<br>Now they were sitting together behind a trailer at the edge of a parking lot.<br>She had sipped her coffee cup dry and then picked the Styrofoam cup to little pieces. Bits of Styrofoam were in her lap and on the sand around her feet like crumbs.<br>"When are they going to tell me what happened?" she asked.<br>She could have rebelled from Fletch's ministrations and found out for herself; She didn't. She had understood enough of what she had seen to prefer acute anxiety to dead certainty.<br>"Breathe deeply," Fletch said.<br>She took a deep breath and choked off a sob.<br>The Rescue Squad ambulance was the first to arrive. Blue lights flashing on the gray day, it threaded its way slowly and carefully down onto the beach. A police car arrived next, its siren and lights on, but seemingly in no great hurry. Some local police had already been assigned to the film location. Then two more police cars came screaming, skidding in as if their drivers hoped the cameras were on. Out of the passenger seat of one emerged a middle-aged woman in uniform.<br>Marge Peterman said, "If they take Steve to the hospital, I want to go with him."<br>Fletch nodded. The ambulance had not returned from the beach, as it would have if there were any necessity to go to the hospital.<br>"I mean, I want to go with him in the ambulance."<br>Fletch nodded again.<br>Most of the people, the film crew, the television crew, the press, had gone down to the beach like pieces of metal being drawn by a magnet. Now a few were returning. As they returned, they walked with their chins down. Their shoulders seemed higher than normal. And the skin beneath their tans seemed touched by bleach. None was talking.<br>Fletch could not hear the murmur of the Gulf or even the chatter of the birds among the palm trees.<br>An airplane taking off from Fort Myers passed overhead.<br>A young woman in shorts, a halter, and sandals appeared around the corner of the trailer and stopped. She looked back toward the beach, wondering what to do, looking for support. A man with a large stomach extending a dark blue T-shirt, with dark curly hair, a light meter dangling from a string around his neck arrived and stood next to the young woman. He kept looking at Marge Peterman's back. A young policeman joined them. He shoved his hat back off his sweaty forehead and looked toward the road, probably wishing there were traffic to direct. One or two other people came to stand with them.<br>Dan Buckley came around the corner of the trailer and looked at each of the people standing there. He, too, hesitated. Then he slowly came forward and put his hand on Marge Peterman' s shoulder.<br>She looked up at him.<br>"Dan . . ."<br>Fletch gave Buckley his chair and stood aside.<br>"Mrs. Peterman . . ." Dan Buckley said. "Marge, is it?"<br>"Yes."<br>"Marge." He leaned forward in the chair, forearms on his thighs. "It seems your husband... It seems Steve is dead. I'm sorry, but . . .<br>Buckley's face lost none of its confident amiability in its seriousness, its sadness. Watching him, Fletch wished that if he ever had to take such bad news, it be broken to him by such a professional face as Dan Buckley's. In Buckley's face there was the built-in assurance that no matter how bad the present facts, there would be a world tomorrow, a show tomorrow, a laugh tomorrow.<br>Marge Peterman stared at Buckley. "What do you mean 'seems to be'?" Her chin quivered. "'Seems to be dead'?"<br>Buckley's hands cupped hers. "Is dead. Steve is dead, uh, Marge."<br>Her face rejected the news, then crumpled in tears. She took her hands from him and put them to her face. "What happened?" she choked. "What happened to Steve?"<br>Buckley looked up at Fletch. Then he sat back in the chair. His eyes ran along a heavy-duty cable strung over the parking lot.<br>He said nothing.<br>The young woman in the halter came forward and put both her hands on Marge Peterman's shoulders. "Come on," she said.<br>Marge stood up and staggered on the flat ground.<br>The man in the blue T-shirt took her arm.<br>Together, the man and the young woman walked Marge Peterman through the trailers to the front of the parking lot.<br>"What did happen?" Fletch asked Buckley. <br>Buckley focused on Fletch. "Who are you?" he asked. Fletch was wearing sailcloth shorts, a tennis shirt, and no shoes. "The Ambassador from Bermuda?"<br>"Sometimes I get coffee for people," Fletch said.<br>Buckley looked over the bits of Styrofoam on the sand. "He got stabbed." He shook his head. "He got a knife stuck in his back. Right on the set. Right on camera."<br>"He was quiet about it," Fletch commented. <br>Buckley was looking at his fingers in his lap as if he had never seen them before. "It could not have happened. It absolutely could not have happened."<br>"But it did though, huh?"<br>Buckley looked up. "Get me a cup of coffee, willya, kid? Black, no sugar.<br>"Black no sugar," Fletch repeated.<br>Fletch walked toward the canteen, past it, through the security gate, got into his rented car and drove off.<br>3<br>The first phone call Fletch made was to Global Cable News in Washington, D.C. His call got through to that hour's producer quickly. It was, 'Yes, sir, Mister Fletcher', 'Yes, sir, Mister Fletcher' all the way through the switchboard and production staff.<br>Recently Fletch had bought a block of stock in Global Cable News. Just ten days before he had toured their offices and studios in Washington.<br>He had allowed everyone to know he was a journalist and they might be hearing from him from time to time.<br>"Yes, sir, Mister Fletcher," said that hour's producer.<br>Fletch looked down at his bare feet on the rotten, sand-studded floorboards of the porch outside the mini-mart. When he was working full time as a journalist, no one in power had ever called him sir. They had called him many other things. He had always known, of course, that behind the power of the free press was the power of the buck. He had never felt the sensation of the power of the buck before. He decided he liked the sensation and that he must work to deprive himself, and others, of any such sensation. A barefoot boy with cheek should be listened to because he's got a story, not because he was able to buy a few shares in the company.<br>"'Sir'?" Fletch said. "To whom am I speaking, please?"<br>"Jim Fennelli, Mister Fletcher. We met last week when you were here. I'm the bald guy with the big side whiskers."<br>"Oh, yeah," Fletch said. Jim Fennelli looked like a stepped-on cotton pod. "The gumdrop fetishist."<br>"That's me," Fennelli chuckled. "A box a day keeps the dentist healthy, wealthy, and sadistic."<br>"You know The Dan Buckley Show?"<br>"Sure. My mother-in-law fantasizes she's married to the creep."<br>"They were taping down here on Bonita Beach this afternoon. On location for a movie called Midsummer Night's Madness."<br>"Cute. Prospero's Island in Florida."<br>Fletch said nothing. No matter how long he lived, he would be amazed at the great mish-mash of information, and misinformation, all journalists carry around in their heads.<br>"Have I got it right?" Fennelli asked.<br>"Sure, sure. On the set of the television show were Buckley, Moxie Mooney, and her manager, Steve Peterman."<br>"So? Mister Fletcher, are you trying to get a publicity shot for somebody? I mean, are you invested in the film, or something? I mean, anything regarding Moxie Mooney will fly, she's gorgeous, but where's Bonita Beach, anyway, north of Naples?"<br>"Yeah. More south of Fort Myers. Call me Fletch. Makes me feel more like me."<br>"That's a hike. We'd have to send people over from Miami. You stockholders, you know. Like us to keep our expenses down."<br>"Send people over from Miami. Steve Peterman was murdered."<br>"Who?"<br>"Peterman. Steven Peterman. Not sure if Steven is spelled with a v or a ph. On television, it doesn't matter how his name is spelled anyway, right?"<br>"Who is he again?"<br>"Some sort of a manager, a friend, of Moxie Mooney. Some kind of a producer of Midsummer Night's Madness."<br>"Yeah, but So what? Nobody knows who he is."<br>"You haven't got the point yet."<br>"My father lives in Naples. It's nice down there."<br>"He was stabbed to death on the set of The Dan Buckley Show while they were taping. While the cameras were running."<br>There was a pause on the other end of the line. "Yeah, that's good," Fennelli said. "You mean they don't know who did it yet? They will as soon as they look at the tapes. Fast story. A six-hour wonder. I'm not saying it's a bad story."<br>"Someone was murdered on camera."<br>"Yeah, but it wasn't a live show. It should be reported, of course."<br>"Obviously, both Moxie Mooney and Dan Buckley are suspects. They were the only ones within reach."</p><h2>On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature</h2><p>The theme of this collection is the excellence of the Story, especially the kind of story dear to Lewis-fantasy and science fiction, which he fostered in an age dominated by realistic fiction.

In 1938 he left Germany for Manchester, England, where he was appointed communal rabbi. While in Manchester he founded the Institute of Jewish Studies that later moved to University College, London. In 1959 he was appointed Professor of Jewish Philosophy at Brandeis University, Massachusetts, and Director of its Lown Institute of Advanced Judaic Studies.`Generally, Judaica books published by university presses are definitive studies certain to be &#34;classics&#34; a hundred years from now.

Illustrated with over 700 photographs, the book provides examples of the extraordinary variety of propelling pencils that were created between 1800 and 1920. Readers will be struck by the ingenuity of the inventors and creators of this (until now) forgotten form of decorative art. From metal cased pencils that are elegantly practical, to &#34;magic&#34; pencils that are more whimsical than functional, this book follows the progress of the mechanical pencil as it evolves from a usable tool to something more akin to jewelry. This history of mechanical pencils also includes definitions of terms, descriptions of various mechanisms, ornamentation and surface decoration, and the multitude of combinations created by nineteenth century pencil-case makers.

Its many treasures include not only Miami Beach&#39;s Art Deco buildings and Coral Gables, but also the houses and commercial buildings of the immediate postwar era, tropical vernacular architecture, mid-century modernism, and avant-garde high-rise buildings on the waterfront. What all these creations have in common is the intention to allure, delight, and engage the imagination and senses. Indeed, many of Miami&#39;s architects have conceived of the city in theatrical terms-a city as stage set. This book covers both well-known masterpieces and the overlooked ones, featuring spectacular color photography as well as archival imagery. With a text that is superbly informed, Miami is at once a definitive scholarly work and a seductive compendium of the area&#39;s fabled architecture.</p><p><b>Beth Dunlop</b> is the author of numerous books, including <i>Arquitectonica</i>.

In Miami it has always been about the land, the way it meets the sea and the sky. Even now, in a city that is very much man-made, the land and the landscape, the sea and the sky hold their power. For many years, the sky was Miami's skyline, more so than the few tall buildings that rose into it. But that is no more. The Miami of the new millennium is a much different place, a city with a flashy skyline of Manhattan-tall buildings, most of them eked out in steel and glass, or less often, the more traditional local building materials of stucco and stone. It is a fast-paced city, one that sometimes appears to have been designed to be seen at sixty-five miles per hour, or perhaps even from an airplane as it descends for landing. For the finer details, one has to slow down and come to earth, of course. The story of this place unfolds in its architecture, in its landscape. And the story continues, changing decade by decade, from the original pioneer cabins on. And though one can find a rare Tudor-style or Colonial Revival building and more than a handful of bungalows, so much of the architecture of Miami is actually notable in its homogeneity--drawing from just four traditions and limited in materials. Wood came first but did not last, and then stone, but the dramatically beautiful local oolitic limestone was not abundant enough to build more than the occasional house in a fast-growing city. By the early twentieth century, wood had begun to yield to concrete, to stucco over block, and until at least the mid-1950s when the first curtain wall buildings were constructed, that is how it remained. It still largely is a stucco city, more in the tradition of the Mediterranean countries that so inspired the architecture that took hold in Florida in the early twentieth century. This was not ordinary land but rather something strange and exotic, unlike most other places known to those who settled it. In the beginning, there was little more than scrub and jungle--the muck and the mangroves--and the huge blue sky with its almost palpable clouds forming an empty tableau. Now we can see it as land simply waiting for picturesque buildings, and eventually the pioneers and the builders came to turn the swampland into paradise and sell it.</p></p><h2>Privateer (The Dragon Corsairs, 2)</h2><p><p><b>The swashbuckling adventures of Captain Kate Fitzmaurice continues in this thrilling continuation of the epic tale of the Dragon Corsairs.</b></p><p>Captain Kate escapes the hangman's noose with the help of Prince Thomas, only to discover to her dismay that her dragon friend, Dalgren, has gone back to his homeland to face trial for desertion.

Strategies for Coping in a World Gone ADD</h2><p>Are you too busy? Are you always running behind? Is your calendar loaded with more than you can possibly accomplish? Is it driving you crazy? You&#x2019;re not alone. CrazyBusy&#x2013;the modern phenomenon of brain overload&#x2013;is a national epidemic. Without intending it or understanding how it happened, we&#x2019;ve plunged ourselves into a mad rush of activity, expecting our brains to keep track of more than they comfortably or effectively can. In fact, as Attention Deficit Disorder expert and bestselling author Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., argues in this groundbreaking new book, this brain overload has reached the point where our entire society is suffering from culturally induced ADD.<br><br>CrazyBusy is not just a by-product of high-speed, globalized modern life&#x2013;it has become its defining feature. BlackBerries, cell phones, and e-mail 24/7. Longer work days, escalating demands, and higher expectations at home. It all adds up to a state of constant frenzy that is sapping us of creativity, humanity, mental well-being, and the ability to focus on what truly matters.<br><br>But as Dr. Hallowell argues, being crazybusy can also be an opportunity. Just as ADD can, if properly managed, become a source of ingenuity and inspiration, so the impulse to be busy can be turned to our advantage once we get in touch with our needs and take charge of how we really want to spend our time. Through quick exercises (perfect for busy people), focused advice on everything from lifestyle to time management, and examples chosen from his extensive clinical experience, Hallowell goes step-by-step through the process of unsnarling frantic lives. With CrazyBusy, we can teach ourselves to move from the F-state&#x2013;frenzied, flailing, fearful, forgetful, furious&#x2013;to the C-state&#x2013;cool, calm, clear, consistent, curious, courteous.<br><br>Dr. Hallowell has helped more than a million readers free themselves of the distractions and compulsions of ADD. Now in CrazyBusy, he offers the same sound, sane, and accessible guidance for anyone suffering from the harried pace of modern life. If you find yourself pulled into a million different directions, here at last is the opportunity to stop being busy, start being happy, and still get things done.</p><p>Edward M.

The cottage was so remote that there was no cell phone service, just the stolid black telephone sitting atop a tattered phone book on an end table next to a worn-out peach-colored couch.<br><br> I remember the first time I dialed that phone. It was morning. I&#x2019;d gone out for a wake-me-up swim, poured myself a cup of coffee, and was sitting on the couch to call a friend to see if he and his kids might like to join my wife, my kids, and me that night at a minor league baseball game. There was no urgency to this call, no need for me to hurry.<br><br> Yet as I started to dial, got angry, and impatience flamed within me because on this phone I had to wait for the rotor to wind back to its starting point after each number. It was so slow! In addition, it made an irritating screeching sound as it retraced its cycle, like a rusty metal drawer stuck on its runners: 5 . . . 4 . . . 2 . . . 6 . . . I could have entered the entire number on a touch-tone phone in the time it took me to dial just one number on this obsolete contraption. Not to mention how much faster I could have done it with speed dial had I been able to use my cell phone.<br><br> By the time I had laboriously cranked out the entire number, I was in a total snit. How could anyone still own such a slow phone? I fumed. What a stupid phone! How backward! How dumb! But then I caught myself. This was absurd. When my friend finally answered, I spoke to him, hung up, and then redialed his number, timing how long it took me: eleven seconds exactly. As if putting my life in danger, those eleven slow seconds had annoyed me beyond reason. What a fool I had become. What a modern man. I felt embarrassed at my automatic impatience. I had become a man in a hurry even when I had no need to hurry.<br><br> As the vacation moved along, I changed. I made friends with that old rotary phone. I began to appreciate what it could teach me. The sound it made started to sound less like a stuck drawer and more like an old windmill still stoutly doing its work after all these years. I came to think of it as a wise counsel, ensconced on its end table like a Buddha cautioning me to take my time and enjoy, while they lasted, the summer, the childhood of my kids, the ripening of my marriage, and these best years of my life.<br><br> Without intending for it to happen or knowing how it got started, many people now find that they live in a rush they don&#x2019;t want and didn&#x2019;t create, or at least didn&#x2019;t mean to create. If you feel busier now than you&#x2019;ve ever been before, and if you wonder if you can keep up this pace much longer, don&#x2019;t feel alone. Most of us feel slightly bewildered, realizing we have more to do than ever&#x2014;with less time to do it.<br><br> Look at what&#x2019;s happened to the usual &#x201c;how are you&#x201d; exchange. It used to go like this: &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Now it often goes like this: &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Busy.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Too busy.&#x201d; Or even, &#x201c;Crazy busy.&#x201d;<br><br> If you&#x2019;re busy doing what matters to you, then being busy is bliss. You&#x2019;ve found a rhythm for your life that works for you. This world is bursting with possibilities; its energy can be contagious. If you catch the bug, you want to jump out of bed each day and get busy, not because you are run ragged by details or because you are keeping the wolf from your door, but because you are in love with this fast life. At its best, modern life dazzles us, giving us a chance to get more done in a minute than used to get done in a month.<br><br> But if being busy keeps you from doing what matters most to you, or if it leads you to do things you deem unwise, like getting angry at a rotary telephone, then being busy is a problem. This book is about both the problem and the opportunity&#x2014;where this peculiar life comes from and how to turn it to your advantage.<br><br> In order to make this crazy world work for you and not against you, you must decide what matters to you most and focus your attention on that. In days gone by, this was not nearly as difficult as it is today. That&#x2019;s because the selection was not nearly as broad, and the thieves of time, attention, and mental energy were not nearly as common or as clever as they are today. Today, these thieves have never had it so good. If you&#x2019;re not wise to their tricks, it is likely that they will run you faster and faster as they steal more and more of your time, attention, and energy, leaving you less and less for what you want to do.<br><br> Being too busy, which can seem necessary and unavoidable, can become a habit so entrenched that it leads you to postpone or cut short what really matters to you, making you a slave to a lifestyle you don&#x2019;t like but can&#x2019;t escape. You can be so busy that you don&#x2019;t even take the time to decide what actually does matter most to you, let alone make the time to do it.<br><br> Others created this lifestyle. It looked like the only way to go, the way of the future. What were you supposed to do, be a Luddite and refuse to buy a cell phone or a BlackBerry? Not go wireless? Refuse to enroll your kids in soccer, violin, and SAT tutoring? Refuse to take on the added debt of the extra week of vacation your spouse and kids were counting on? Have simple birthday parties the way they used to in the 1950s and 1960s? Figure out a way to live with just one car? Or just two? Say no to braces for your daughter? Let your yard go to seed? Refuse to give your time to the cancer foundation your friend is heading up? Refuse to do the extra work your boss asks you to do because half your staff got laid off? What if you&#x2019;re next?<br><br> Unaware of the hidden consequences, and without making a conscious decision to do so, soon you found that you and your family had joined right in. It happened slowly, over the past five to ten years. Had you known then what you know now, you might have done things differently. It is like the story of frogs in water. If you put a frog in a pot of boiling water, he will try to jump out. But if you put a frog in a pot of cold water and heat it up slowly, you will end up with a boiled frog.<br><br> Someone turned up the burner on us in the mid-1990s. We&#x2019;re not boiled yet, but we&#x2019;re definitely feeling the heat. Before the water boils, it might be a good idea to jump out. Not jump out of modern life and head off to Walden Pond (though even it swarms with busy tourists), but adjust the temperature yourself instead of letting some diabolical chef set it for you.<br><br> The greatest damage from being too busy is that it prevents people from setting their own temperature, controlling their own lives. It does other harm as well, like increasing toxic stress, making people sick, causing accidents and errors, turning otherwise polite people rude, and reducing the general level of happiness in the population. But the greatest damage it does is that it keeps a person from what&#x2019;s most important.<br><br> Being too busy is a persistent and pestering problem, one that is leading tens of millions of Americans to feel as if they were living in a swarm of gnats constantly taking bites out of their lives. All the screaming and swatting in the world does not make them go away. Being too busy plagues the best and brightest people in this country, if not the world. Legions of smart people everywhere feel overly busy; they rack their brains to find a better way, struggling to regain control of their lives. I want to explore this difficult problem, offer some solutions that can work for you, and most important, prompt you to create your own solutions.</p><h2>Yours for Eternity: A Love Story on Death Row</h2><p>From one of the greatest legal injustices of our time sprang one of the most unlikely&#x2014;and unforgettable&#x2014;love stories. Damien Echols was just eighteen years old when he was condemned to death for a crime he didn&#x2019;t commit. His case&#x2014;that of the infamous &#x201c;West Memphis Three&#x201d;&#x2014;gained notoriety after a documentary, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, exposed the biased nature of the trial and Echols as the precocious, charming&#x2014;and tragic&#x2014;figure at its center. Lorri Davis was a landscape architect living in New York City when she surreptitiously wandered into a showing of the film, and she left forever changed. She, too, was from the South, accustomed to being the outsider in a small town. She saw much of herself in Echols, understood how he could easily have been swept up in a witch hunt, and she couldn&#x2019;t get him out of her head. So she wrote him a letter&#x2014;and when it arrived in Echols&#x2019;s penitentiary cell in April 1996, hers were some of the first kind words of support he heard.<br><br>Over the course of a remarkable sixteen-year correspondence, Echols and Davis grew to know each other, fall in love, and marry&#x2014;all without ever being able to touch each other freely or be alone together. In <i>Yours for Eternity</i>, their extraordinary letters provide a singular portrait of their marriage, from the first, heady days of discovery to the final, painful months before Echols&#x2019;s release. Through postscripts and footnotes, Echols and Davis describe how they overcame the enormous challenges and heartbreaks throughout the years&#x2014;personal setbacks, legal complications, and much more. <i>Yours for Eternity</i> reveals a relationship unfolding in the most exceptional of circumstances. Powerful and incredibly intimate, it is a modern-day love story for the ages.</p><p><b>DAMIEN ECHOLS </b>and <b>LORRI DAVIS </b>met in 1996, and were married in a Buddhist ceremony at Tucker Maximum Security Unit in Arkansas in 1999. Echols spent nearly eighteen years on death row until his release in 2011. He is the author of the <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling memoir <i>Life After Death</i>. For more than a decade, Davis spearheaded a full-time effort toward her husband&#x2019;s release from prison, which encompassed all aspects of the legal case and forensic investigation. She and Echols, who together produced the documentary <i>West</i> <i>of Memphis, </i>live in New York.***This excerpt is from an advance corrected proof***<br><br>Copyright � 2014 Damien Echols Publishing <br><br><p><b>authors&#x2019; note</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we began our journey together, now nearly twenty years ago, we hadn&#x2019;t a clue what was in store for us. A young man on death row in Arkansas caught up in a terrible sequence of events and wrongful convictions. A woman in New York City who loved to go to the movies. Fate drew us inexplicably together&#x2014;and we&#x2019;ve spent the rest of our lives trying to explain the hows and whys of falling in love and building a life. There&#x2019;s no easy answer for why we wrote those first letters&#x2014; why a young, successful woman writes a letter to a man in prison&#x2014;and most especially why we kept on writing those letters. Except that the more we helped each other deal with pain and fear, the greater our hope for freedom and joy grew. There were terribly dark days, months, and years, and yet we survived&#x2014;as many married people do, regardless of their circumstances. The moments of ecstasy, romance, humor, and companionship burned brighter for the obstacles we faced. Again, like any married couple has faced.</p><p>We wrote thousands and thousands of letters to each other between 1996 and 2011, when Damien was released. Sometimes five or six a day. It was a daunting task to reread and select the ones that best told our story, not to mention the occasional letter that we came across unopened&#x2014;either one of us must have saved it to read later, and received a second or third letter that day and forgotten about it. We spoke too often to keep track. We didn&#x2019;t always date the letters, so we&#x2019;ve gone by postmarks here rather than the day they were written, and some span the course of several days before they were mailed. We have hundreds of mailmen to thank for keeping our love alive, and for bringing us both the words we needed to live by every day.</p><p>&#x2014;Lorri Davis and</p><p>Damien Echols</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>April 1996</p><p>Dear Damien,</p><p>I really wanted to wait until you had a chance to reply to my letter (if you wanted to) before I bombarded you with another, but I have so many thoughts running through my head&#x2014;I have decided to write them all down.</p><p>By the way&#x2014;if I am encroaching on your privacy in any way&#x2014; and you don&#x2019;t want me to write&#x2014;please don&#x2019;t hesitate to let me know. Like I have mentioned already a few times&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know why I feel compelled to have contact with you&#x2014;I just do&#x2014;so I will write until you tell me to stop. I found an article in the New Yorker that you might find interesting&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know what your legal situation is&#x2014;the film doesn&#x2019;t go into much detail about your appeal&#x2014;what is happening? I have a friend whose father knows Kevin Doyle&#x2014;I would like to make your case apparent to him&#x2014;but only with your permission. I don&#x2019;t even know what would happen&#x2014;but I figure the more people who know&#x2014;the more will be done. I know the movie will help when it comes out&#x2014;but in the meantime I will tell everyone I know about you.</p><p>How far away from West Memphis is Tucker? Do you get many visitors?</p><p>In the movie, your family and girlfriend (wife?)&#x2014;that wasn&#x2019;t clear&#x2014;she says you asked her to marry you&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s all&#x2014;they came across as very caring, compassionate people. I hope you have a lot of support from them. I hope you get to see your son. How long have you been incarcerated? What are your days like&#x2014;do you share a cell with someone? Please excuse my ignorance, I just want a semblance of what your life is presently.</p><p>I hope it doesn&#x2019;t freak you out to have someone that you don&#x2019;t even know mooning over you so much. It kind of freaks me out that this is happening to me. I cry about it a lot. I am fortunate enough to have a job that allows me to listen to music and draw all day&#x2014;but since I have become &#x201c;acquainted&#x201d; with you it&#x2019;s difficult&#x2014;because I think about your situation all the time. I&#x2019;m trying to figure out a positive way to deal with it. If I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;well, I already have, right? I honestly believe that undying hope can do wonders in this world. Damien, I can&#x2019;t say that I believe in &#x201c;God&#x201d;; but something has brought you into my life, and as daunting as it is to me sometimes, I know it&#x2019;s a good thing.</p><p>I hope with all my heart you are O.K.</p><p>I am sending you a photograph of the place Father Damien had his colony on the island of Molokai. Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful? Such a beautiful place for such misery at one time.</p><p>The original King Kong was filmed on that rock in the center of the photograph.</p><p>That dark figure to the right is me. I was a little reluctant to send you a photograph of me&#x2014;but I suppose it is only fair.</p><p>The graveyard has an empty grave where Father Damien was buried, but his body was eventually shipped back to Belgium.</p><p>O.K. I&#x2019;ll stop for now.</p><p>As I said before and will continue to say&#x2014;let me know if I can send anything in particular to you. If you don&#x2019;t tell me I&#x2019;m going to start sending you Danielle Steel novels and really nasty-smelling aftershave and sardines in mustard sauce, and pieces of red string that I find on the street, and last but certainly not least&#x2014;a large pod of some sort.</p><p>I will, too.</p><p>Bye, </p><p>Lorri</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>April 1996</p><p>Dear Lorri,</p><p>Believe me, I in no way think that my privacy is being invaded and I do not mind being &#x201c;bombarded with letters.&#x201d; I just sent off another letter to you a couple days ago, which you should have gotten right before this one. I can&#x2019;t remember if I enclosed those articles I was telling you about or not, so if I forgot, just remind me, and I&#x2019;ll get them out to you.</p><p>Thank you for the article from the New Yorker. I had read it a couple days before; I have a subscription to the New Yorker. I love the little cartoons they print.</p><p>I certainly don&#x2019;t mind you making my case known to Kevin Doyle. I would not object to anything that could possibly help.</p><p>Yes, I&#x2019;m sure the film will convince a lot of people in other states of my innocence, but what worries me is whether or not the people of Arkansas will pay attention. They refuse to look at the evidence and they refuse to listen to reason. All they want is to see somebody die for those crimes and a &#x201c;freak&#x201d; like me is just as good as anyone. The whole attitude scares the hell out of me.</p><p>Thank you for telling everyone about me. Maybe if everyone were to take as big an interest as you have things could happen a lot faster. It just seems that most people just don&#x2019;t care, or they&#x2019;re so close-minded they won&#x2019;t even try to see the truth.</p><p>How far is West Memphis from Tucker? Exactly 147 miles. Yes, I usually have a visitor every week. My family and friends have really pulled together and they try to stay pretty close to me. They&#x2019;ve been very supportive. No, unfortunately, I don&#x2019;t get to see my son. He&#x2019;ll be three years old this year, and I haven&#x2019;t seen him since he was about 5 months. My girlfriend moved to Arizona and took him with her. I haven&#x2019;t seen or heard from either of them since the trial. She&#x2019;s gone on with her life. I really can&#x2019;t blame her, I guess, since I&#x2019;ve been locked up 3 years now. Maybe it&#x2019;s for the best, but it still hurts like hell.</p><p>My life? Well, I have my own cell, which I spend 22 hours a day inside of. I&#x2019;m allowed to go outside for 2 hours a day, but I usually don&#x2019;t, because I&#x2019;m not allowed around any of the other prisoners, and when you do go out, you just stand in a fenced square like a dog kennel and bake in the sun. I spend most of my time just lying on the bed listening to the radio and reading. There&#x2019;s absolutely nothing to do, but for some reason it still seems like time goes by incredibly fast. It&#x2019;s kind of hard to believe I&#x2019;ve been here this long. It doesn&#x2019;t seem like it.</p><p>No, I don&#x2019;t believe in Christianity&#x2019;s version of God, either, but from the very beginning of this situation, I&#x2019;ve felt that there had to be a purpose for all of this. Now I just have to figure out what the purpose is, so I can go home. J Maybe this is just a way to pay off some karma I&#x2019;ve built up in the past or something.</p><p>Thank you for the picture. Yes, it is beautiful. I hope to one day be able to go there for myself.</p><p>Why are you afraid for me to see what you look like? I&#x2019;m not so shallow as to judge you by your physical appearance. Just relax and be natural. Trust me, we&#x2019;ll get along great.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure that I&#x2019;m in need of any Danielle Steel novels, nasty-smelling aftershave, bits of red string, or a pod of some sort, though I do appreciate the gesture. J I can only have things made of paper. Remember, I am a dangerous lunatic. J</p><p>Right now, my first appeal hasn&#x2019;t even been heard yet. My case goes before the Arkansas Supreme Court on September second. We expect to be denied though. We don&#x2019;t expect to get any help until we reach federal court.</p><p>I guess I&#x2019;m going to close for now, but I can&#x2019;t wait to hear from you again. You&#x2019;re a sweetie.</p><p>Forever, </p><p>Damien</p></p><h2>The Sign Painter: A Novel</h2><p>A deeply emotive story about a young mother struggling to get back on her feet after a devastating loss leaves both her and her daughter alone and living on the street&#x2014;from bestselling and award-winning author Davis Bunn.<br><br>Amy Dowell had always considered herself a very good mother.

She did not allow her circumstances to dictate how much love she had to give. She did not permit the presence of worries to color the way she greeted her daughter. &#x201c;Good morning, darling.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to get up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, sweetheart.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It got loud last night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But we were safe here inside our little home, weren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In our love cave.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.

Amy&#x2019;s daughter had hated the sound of truck engines ever since the two of them had been forced onto the road. It was why they seldom stayed in truck stops. The rumbling motors gave her terrible nightmares.<br> <br>Kimmie scrunched herself into the crook of her mother&#x2019;s neck and squealed. Amy raised her voice to be heard over the departing truck. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, honey. It&#x2019;s leaving.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The big bad truck wants to eat me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it doesn&#x2019;t, darling. There, see, it&#x2019;s gone now.&#x201d; Amy dropped the plastic holdall with their washing items into her backpack. She had a purse, but it remained stowed in the cabinet over the sink. Carrying a purse was something from a different life. Amy waited until the truck had merged with the sparse dawn traffic to open the door. By mid-May, central Florida was already hot and sticky at six-thirty in the morning. Kimmie was big enough to walk under her own steam, but Amy carried her anyway. It was hard managing the flimsy stairs while hefting her daughter and the bulky pack. But she had grown used to much harder tasks than this one.<br> <br>Their home was a camper cab bolted to a Ford truck. The pickup had a hundred and seventy-two thousand hard miles, and the massive eight-cylinder motor sucked gas. The tires were bald and the front windshield was cracked. The previous evening, Amy had parked in a service station&#x2019;s rear lot, behind the car wash. After the nine P.M. shift change, the lone attendant of such stations rarely left the bulletproof enclosure. A year back, Amy never would have dreamed that such knowledge might prove vital. Or that she would become proficient at picking locks, which she managed with Kimmie wrapped around her neck. All service stations had cameras surveying the restroom doors. But at six-thirty in the morning, half an hour before the shift ended, the attendant rarely paid attention to the security screens. Amy opened the restroom lock in ten seconds flat.<br> <br>Once they were cleaned up, Amy returned to the camper and gave careful attention to Kimmie&#x2019;s hair. The five-year-old whined a bit over the inevitable tangles but mostly stayed quiet. By now Kimberly was familiar with their new-city routine. So much depended upon them both putting on their best face. Kimberly had hair like summer wheat, dry and blond and so fine that it poofed out with static electricity when brushed hard. Sometimes that was good for a laugh, but not this morning. Amy was in a hurry, and Kimmie was still sleepy.<br> <br>Amy dressed her daughter in a clean T-shirt and jeans, then let Kimmie curl up with her blanket in the passenger seat. Amy flattened the sheet of instructions she had copied down the previous evening from MapQuest. Another thing she had mastered over the past eighteen months was finding her way through strange cities.<br> <br>As they turned onto Highway 192, Brentonville&#x2019;s main thoroughfare, a pair of police cars came flashing past. Amy could not completely hide her flinch. Her fear of cops was genuine and well founded. Her most dread nightmare was of some new city&#x2019;s social services trying to steal Kimmie away. Not to mention the fact that her vehicle was a rolling list of violations. No one knew cops like the homeless. It was a fact of life on the road.<br> <br>The church was easy enough to locate. The main building rose north of the thoroughfare that ran arrow-straight to Disney. It was good that Kimmie was drowsing, because they passed a giant sign advertising the theme parks farther west. That was all Amy needed, having her daughter freak out over how close they were to the Magic Kingdom.<br> <br>The First Methodist Church complex dominated two full city blocks. Amy had researched it on her laptop the previous day, after the job offer had been confirmed. Most big cities had at least one such church, where the problems of today&#x2019;s world were not hidden beyond the barrier of faith. There were websites dedicated to people like Amy, live boards that posted helpful information about every city in the nation. Some of the sites were specifically designed to help single mothers: where to go, where to stay, what to avoid. How to survive.<br> <br>Newcomers without roots were not always welcome in churches. Which was why Amy parked her truck at the back of the church lot, then brushed Kimmie&#x2019;s hair a second time and fitted in the two pink plastic hair clips and straightened her T-shirt before getting in close to her daughter and saying, &#x201c;What are we going to do when we get inside?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Smile and be nice,&#x201d; Kimmie replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my good girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Will they have eggs, Mommy?&#x201d;<br> <br>She took the little girl&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we go and see?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Many city churches with schools and day-care centers served breakfast for students and families. These days, too many of their charges arrived hungry. This free meal was generally restricted to people signed into the system. Others had to pay. Sometimes, though, Amy was able to slip in. It just depended on the church and the day. As they joined the line, she saw a father with three young boys set money on the counter. Amy gave a silent sigh and reached into her jeans. She hated having to use her gas money for food, but she needed a safe place to leave Kimmie.<br> <br>The desk inside the cafeteria doors was staffed by a woman with an expression that Amy had come to know all too well. The woman&#x2019;s name tag read LUCY. Her no-nonsense gaze held the hard-earned wisdom of having long experience with Amy&#x2019;s world.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re new,&#x201d; the woman said.<br> <br>&#x201c;We just arrived last night.&#x201d; Amy tried to make her voice as cheery as possible.<br> <br>Lucy motioned for Amy to swing around to the side of the desk. The woman continued to accept breakfast vouchers as she asked, &#x201c;Where from?&#x201d;<br> <br>Amy knew the administrator&#x2019;s easy tone masked a well-honed ability to sense trouble before it started. The only way to handle a person like this was not to try and handle her. People like Lucy had heard all the hard-luck pleas and were not moved. Amy gave it to her honest and straight. &#x201c;Tampa, and before that, Tallahassee. Before that, Atlanta.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kimmie reached for her mother&#x2019;s hand and said softly, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t like &#x2019;Lanta.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Neither of us did,&#x201d; Amy agreed.<br> <br>The woman smiled a greeting to a young family and asked, &#x201c;So why go?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Work. I was a graphic designer, you know . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Before,&#x201d; the woman supplied, looking at her with a glint of what might have been sympathy. &#x201c;And now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mommy paints pretty windows,&#x201d; Kimmie said, a trace of genuine pride in her voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a sign painter,&#x201d; Amy explained.<br> <br>The woman appeared won over by Kimmie. &#x201c;You have work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Supposedly. At Denton Chevrolet. I won&#x2019;t know for sure until I show up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you need a place for your little one to stay.&#x201d; She smiled as she handed Amy two breakfast vouchers. &#x201c;Go eat. I&#x2019;ll stop by later. We&#x2019;ll chat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amy fumbled her thanks and hated how her fingers trembled as she stuffed the crumpled bills back in her jeans. The woman noticed. Amy suspected that Lucy missed very little. She gave Amy another smile, one survivor to another, and said to Kimmie, &#x201c;I believe I saw them making waffles.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kimmie&#x2019;s delight was genuine. &#x201c;My favorite!&#x201d;<br> <br>Amy thanked the woman again and joined the breakfast line. She gave her eyes a quick swipe when she thought no one was watching. She had grown used to this, how an unexpected kindness threatened to unravel her control.<br> <br>Amy filled Kimmie&#x2019;s plate with sausage and waffles, then took eggs and sausage and hash browns and biscuits for herself. Kimberly hated how the syrup ran over her sausage, but the little girl had learned not to say anything. They walked down the central aisle. Amy veered away from the first table with free seats because of the man she spotted just as she was about to sit down. He was in his late forties, and very handsome in a chiseled fashion, and clearly a cop. Which was why the only other people seated at the table with him were church workers. The man might as well have had a stone wall built around him. No one else even looked his way. Amy was far from the only person in the room harboring bad memories from run-ins with the police.<br> <br>Amy spotted two places at a table holding several Bibles. She smiled a greeting and let Kimmie snuggle up next to her on the bench. The room was filled with pinched features and faces bearing the remnants of a leathery tan. Many of the gazes were hooded and fiercely aware, all products of life on the street. Amy knew she was gaining some of the same telltales and was helpless to do anything about it. Another of her nightmares was waking up one morning and discovering the same traits drawn on Kimberly&#x2019;s young face.<br> <br>There was no conversation at their table. This was another thing she once found remarkable and now accepted as normal, how silent most people were. People on the verge knew others had no interest in hearing their worries. They also knew someone here might be very close to exploding and could be set off by the smallest word. Quiet was safe.<br> <br>Lucy took a seat at the table across the aisle and watched as Amy helped Kimmie cut her waffle and sausage. When Amy finished her meal, she unzipped her pack and pulled out a Bible. The woman observed that, too. Amy had no idea why Lucy was so interested in them. But eighteen months on the road had taught her to judge people swiftly and well. She sensed no danger from Lucy. Amy opened her Bible to the passage that was listed on the board by the front podium. Let the woman watch.<br> <br>The woman stepped to the front podium and introduced herself as Lucy Watts, head of the church&#x2019;s outreach ministries. She led them in prayer, then preached a brief sermon. Amy followed the words with determined intensity. These daily lessons were a vital part of her holding on to what was most precious in her life, including the ability to set aside all her worries and burdens, and show her young daughter the love she needed. Amy had learned to clamp down on the questions for which there were no answers. Such as how God could allow these things to happen, or when they would find a way out of their impossible situation, or where she could offer her daughter a future. Stability. A home. All the things that had become impossible dreams. All the things that Amy was determined to regain.<br> <br>When Lucy left the podium, she walked down the aisle, greeting several latecomers and hugging one woman who rose from Amy&#x2019;s table. Lucy seated herself across the table from Amy. She reached over and swung Amy&#x2019;s Bible around. The two pages were underlined, with thoughts and prayers written into the margins. &#x201c;A student of the Word. I like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all that holds my life together.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know what you mean.&#x201d; Lucy&#x2019;s gaze drifted over the rapidly emptying room. &#x201c;I wish I could wake up a few of the nodders to that same truth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t condemn them,&#x201d; Amy replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d probably have given in to the same bitterness, except for one thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucy watched Amy stroke her daughter&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;Where do you live?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My husband&#x2019;s camper. It was actually his dad&#x2019;s. He used it for hunting trips.&#x201d; Amy looked down at her little one. &#x201c;I was after him for years to get rid of that old thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You lost him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty-two months ago.&#x201d; The terse response was all that was required. Amy settled her hand over her daughter&#x2019;s ear and pressed so that the other ear was covered by her body. &#x201c;Cancer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You lost your home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. First I lost my job. Then my health benefits. Then I declared bankruptcy. The home went last.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kimmie squirmed and pushed Amy&#x2019;s hand away. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t breathe, Mommy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, darling.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucy rose from her place. &#x201c;Mind showing me where you live?&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>The Ford pickup had never looked more battered. The camper&#x2019;s rust spots were glaring blemishes in the morning sun. The door shuddered as Amy pulled it open. The old vehicle seemed as embarrassed as she was over having someone see how they lived. Amy had forgotten how loudly the right rear suspension creaked when someone climbed the stairs. Lucy entered and slipped into one of the two chairs by the narrow fold-down table. She gave the cabin a very slow look.<br> <br>Amy settled on the bed and pulled Kimmie into her lap. She had no idea why Lucy was here. But she knew an interview when she saw one. For what, Amy had no idea. Even so, she felt a faint thrill of electricity run up her spine. Maybe, just maybe, this woman would give Kimmie a free place in their day-care center. It would make all the difference in the world, knowing her little girl was taken care of by people like Lucy while Amy was off at work. Making money. Trying to climb out of this hole.<br> <br>Lucy pointed at the drawings taped over the window above the sink. &#x201c;Your daughter has real talent.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you hear that, honey? The nice lady likes your art.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mommy only puts up the ones that make her happy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name, sweetheart?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kimmie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost five and a half.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amy added, &#x201c;In two months.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2018;almost,&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t it, Mommy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, darling. You&#x2019;re my big good girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucy asked, &#x201c;You select the drawings that are happy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the best reinforcement I can give her,&#x201d; Amy replied. She heard the shiver in her own voice. Please, oh, please let this woman give my baby a day-care place and for free!<br> <br>Lucy nodded and did not speak. She continued to look around the cramped confines. Amy&#x2019;s gaze tracked along with hers. She saw the battered equipment and the neat rows of possessions, the shelf with Kimmie&#x2019;s toys and dolls, the shelf where their clothes were folded, the scruffy cabinet with the cans of emergency food and their two plates and two cups and two knives and forks. The narrow sink beneath the opposite window was clean; the drying rack held their soup bowls and glasses and spoons from dinner the previous night.<br> <br>Finally, Lucy rose from her chair and started for the door. &#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Together they walked through the parking lot shared by the outreach center and a small medical clinic and the crisis pregnancy center. Lucy took them along a covered walk past the main church buildings, crossed a street, and stood before what formerly was a down-at-the-heels strip motel. Amy&#x2019;s heart started beating so fast, she thought it might escape from her chest.<br> ...</p><h2>Blue Moon over Thurman Street</h2><p>To walk a street is to be told a story. Blue Moon over Thurman Street weaves a story not only of a particular street but of an American way of life. For more than thirty years, Ursula K. Le Guin has walked Thurman Street in Portland, Oregon, listening to its story and dreaming of a book in which to share it. On a blue moon in July 1985, Le Guin enlisted the photographic talents of Roger Dorband, a fellow Portlander, and they collaborated for seven years to tell this story.<br>Le Guin's handwritten poems, Dorband's creative photographs, and their collaborative observations take you on a personal guided tour of a street that crosses America. Once you've finished the walk up Thurman Street, consider sending a friend on of the postcards attached to the inside flaps. Share the Journey!</p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin--author of more than 80 short stories, 2 collections of essays, 3 volumes of poetry, and 16 novels--has lived on Thurman Street in Portland, Oregon, for more than 25 years. In 1985, on the night of a blue moon, she teamed with photographer Roger Dorbland, a neighbor, to document the 45 blocks of Thurman Street, which lead from industrial warehouses, through poor neighborhoods and wealthy, up a hill to a park with 38 miles of forested trails. Le Guin and Dorbland wanted to capture what was both unique and commonplace about such a city street, and they also caught, through the years, the "gentrification/yuppification/upscaling" often so destructive to older neighborhoods' communities. The result is a delightful browser, with many levels to explore: Le Guin offers handwritten poetry, overheard conversations, and selections from the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>; Dorbland provides photographs covering the years and seasons; and Le Guin and Dorbland fill an appendix with little anecdotes and comments about the photographs. Dorbland's pictures are worth a thousand words, and Le Guin's poems are worth a thousand pictures: "Souls take their own ways / sideways." <i>Eloise Kinney</i></p><h2>Angels 101: An Introduction to Connecting, Working, and Healing with the Angels</h2><p>"Do you have a book about angels for someone who&#x2019;s a complete beginner?"

NOT ex-library. The book was gently read and is very sharp. The jacket generally is sharp. It has moderate signs of handling and a few tiny stains, including one on the lower end of the spine.</p><p>Carson McCullers (1917-1967) was the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including <em>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</em>, <em>The Member of the Wedding</em>, <em>Reflections in a Golden Eye</em>, and <em>Clock Without Hands</em>. Born in Columbus, Georgia, on February 19, 1917, she became a promising pianist and enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York when she was seventeen, but lacking money for tuition, she never attended classes. Instead she studied writing at Columbia University, which ultimately led to <em>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</em>, the novel that made her an overnight literary sensation. On September 29, 1967, at age fifty, she died in Nyack, New York, where she is buried.This work collects for the first time all 19 of McCullers's stories from a 1951 edition and from The Mortgaged Heart (1971). Her most critically acclaimed novels round out the reader, while the author's biographer Virginia Carr provides a lucid, thoughtful introduction. McCullers patented the Southern gothic genre that embraces grotesque, morbid characters with such pervading themes as unrequited love and wounded adolescence. Largely set in the South and richly autobiographical, her writings have endured because of their great power and originality. Sure to appeal to the general reader, the volume will also satisfy scholars with its broad look at McCullers's oeuvre. Edward C.

He wanted to observe the hajj as an anthropologist but also to experience it as an ordinary pilgrim, and to write about it for both Muslims and non-Muslims. Here is his intimate, intense, and detailed account of the Hajj--a rare and important document by a subtle, learned, and sympathetic writer. Hammoudi describes not just the adventure, the human pressures, and the social tumult--everything from the early preparations to the last climactic scenes in the holy shrines of Medina and Mecca--but also the intricate politics and amazing complexity of the entire pilgrimage experience. He pays special heed to the effects of Saudi bureaucratic control over the Hajj, to the ways that faith itself becomes a lucrative source of commerce for the Arabian kingdom, and to the Wahhabi inflections of the basic Muslim message. Here, too, is a poignant discussion of the inner voyage that pilgrimage can mean to those who embark on it: the transformed sense of daily life, of worship, and of political engagement. Hammoudi acknowledges that he was spurred to reconsider his own ideas about faith, gesture, community, and nationality in unanticipated ways. This is a remarkable work of literature about both the outer forms and the inner meanings of Islam today.</p><p>In 1999, the Moroccan scholar Abdellah Hammoudi, trained in Paris and teaching in America, decided to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca.

The text is composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare. It is commonly thought of as a definitive work on military strategy and tactics. It has been the most famous and influential of China's Seven Military Classics, and "for the last two thousand years it remained the most important military treatise in Asia, where even the common people knew it by name." It has had an influence on Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond.<br> <br> Beyond its military and intelligence applications from earliest days to the present time, THE ART OF WAR has been applied to many fields well outside of the military. Much of the text is about how to fight wars without actually having to do battle: it gives tips on how to outsmart one's opponent so that physical battle is not necessary. As such, it has found application as a training guide for many competitive endeavors that do not involve actual combat. There are business books applying its lessons to office politics and corporate strategy. Many companies make the book required reading for their key executives. The book is also popular among Western business management, who have turned to it for inspiration and advice on how to succeed in competitive business situations. It has also been applied to the field of education. The Art of War has been the subject of law books and legal articles on the trial process, including negotiation tactics and trial strategy.</p></p><p><i>The Art of War</i> is the Swiss army knife of military theory--pop out a different tool for any situation. Folded into this small package are compact views on resourcefulness, momentum, cunning, the profit motive, flexibility, integrity, secrecy, speed, positioning, surprise, deception, manipulation, responsibility, and practicality. Thomas Cleary's translation keeps the package tight, with crisp language and short sections. Commentaries from the Chinese tradition trail Sun-tzu's words, elaborating and picking up on puzzling lines. Take the solitary passage: "Do not eat food for their soldiers." Elsewhere, Sun-tzu has told us to plunder the enemy's stores, but now we're not supposed to eat the food? The Tang dynasty commentator Du Mu solves the puzzle nicely, "If the enemy suddenly abandons their food supplies, they should be tested first before eating, lest they be poisoned." Most passages, however, are the pinnacle of succinct clarity: "Lure them in with the prospect of gain, take them by confusion" or "Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability is in the opponent." Sun-tzu's maxims are widely applicable beyond the military because they speak directly to the exigencies of survival. Your new tools will serve you well, but don't flaunt them. Remember Sun-tzu's advice: "Though effective, appear to be ineffective." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war.

The week before Christmas starts off cold, dull, and lonely for Eric, with none of his friends around and both his parents working overtime at their stores. When an exterminator arrives to set off a smoke bomb in his apartment, Eric welcomes the diversion, and soon finds himself enlisted in the antivermin war conducted by this eclectic and ultimately terrifying character, who calls himself Anje, short for Anjela Gabrail. Instructed to help trap and kill a rat hiding in the basement storage room, Eric finds himself gradually shifting sides and plotting to protect the rat, despite a death threat from the exterminator. Readers can develop their own theories about Anje, but most will remain confused about whether he is indeed the Angel Gabriel (an appended note briefly discusses Gabriel's presence in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions), or a fantastic but unholy apparition, or a figment of Eric's imagination. Each answer leaves unexplained questions. Although the book is unsatisfying as a Christmas story, readers who enjoy suspense will find this a fast-moving, mysterious, and unsettling tale. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The use of systems being tested was not limited to aviation as aircraft were also utilized for other purposes including testing components of ballistic missile systems. <p><i>Soviet and Russian Testbed Aircraft</i> investigates all categories of test and research aircraft: engine testbeds including the Il-76LL and Tu-16LL, radar testbeds such as the SL-18P based on the well-known Il-18 airliner; electronic warfare system testbeds such as the Il-76-11, and those for weapons, aerodynamics, and control configured vehicles like the LMK-2405.</p><p> In addition testbeds for landing gear, ejection seats such as the An-12M LL and Su-29KS, refueling systems, and helicopters modified as rotor system were created. Civil research aircraft, such as the An-12BPTs 'Tsiklon' weather research aircraft and IMARK geophysical survey aircraft are also given due attention. The MiG-27LL and MiG-29KVP aircraft used for testing conventional take-off and landing technologies during the Soviet CTOL aircraft carrier development program are also examined. Comprehensive details of each aircraft are coupled with information on the test centers from which these testbeds operate including the M. M. Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovskiy, and the Air Force's 929th State Flight Test Centre in Akhtoobinsk. </p><p>More than 500 photographs, line drawings, close-up views of tell-tale 'bumps and bulges' and color profiles illustrate the aircraft providing a wealth of information for the historian and modeler alike.</p></p><p>Yefim Gordon is one of Russia's leading aviation writers and publishers.

Raphael Samuel reveals the palimpsest of British National Histories, offering a searching yet affectionate account of the heroes and villains, legends and foibles, cherished by the &#x201c;four nations&#x201d; that inhabit the British Isles. Raphael Samuel is interested by the fact that traditions can disappear no less abruptly than they were invented. How is it, her asks, that the Scots have lost interest in a British narrative of which they were once a central protagonist? Why is the celebration of &#x201c;Britons&#x201d; thriving today just as its object has become problematic?<br><br>Island Stories marvelously conveys the mutability of national conceits. Samuel calls as witness a galaxy of authorities&#x2014;Bede and Gerald of Barri, Macaulay and Stubbs, Shakespeare and Dickens, Lord Reith and Raymond Williams, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Benn&#x2014;each of whom sought to renew the sense of national identity be means of an acute sense of the past. <i>Island Stories</i> is a luminous study of the way nations use their past to lend meaning to the present and future. This sequel to the widely acclaimed <i>Theatres of Memory</i> is as passionate, unexpected and enjoyable as its predecessor.</p><p><b>Raphael Samuel</b> (1934&#x2013;1996) was a tutor in History at Ruskin College, Oxford, and a founding editor of <i>History Workshop Journal.</i> His works include <i>Theatres of Memory</i> and <i>Island Stories</i>, also from Verso. For more information about his work, see The Raphael Samuel History Centre and Archive online.A collection of scholarly, oddly compelling essays that aim to unravel the complexities of British identity. Historian Samuel intended Island Storiesthe second installment of a planned trilogyto address ``the wildly different versions of the national past on offer at any given time, depending on whether the optic is that of town or country, center or periphery, the state or civil society.'' Although he died of cancer before he could complete the project, his longtime editors and literary executors completed it posthumously, bringing together key essays intended for the book, many of them on the verge of completion, others unfinished. The result is an odd pastiche that encompasses a variety of forms: essay, argument, travelogue, and personal memoir. It seems less a definitive history than a history of definitionsSamuel clearly delighted in pulling apart the labels that have often been applied to the inhabitants of the so-called United Kingdom. Current events are proving it to be anything but, and Samuel made a point of noting that ``the unity of the British Isles, so far from being the norm, can appear rather as an exceptional condition.'' Samuel examines the myths and oppositions inherent in the idea of Britain: Saxon and Celt, urban and rural, middle class and working class. Samuel's timeliness is indisputable: Nationality has become the key issue, the ``storm-center'' around which domestic politics in Britain now revolve. Indeed, there is a strange discomfort in using the word ``British''; Samuel himself described it as capable of generating ``a vertiginous sense of impending loss.'' Rather than being a ``secure, genetic identity,'' he wrote, ``[it] can be seen as something culturally and historically conditioned, always in the making, never made.'' Strangely enough, the same could be said of his book. As fascinating and politically astute as Island Stories is, it suffers nonetheless from a lingering incompletion.

Here the author of Murder in the Blue Room takes Eleanor away from the White House and environs, surrounding her with first-class accommodations--and classy but suspicious characters--aboard the luxury liner Normandie. When a shady Russian envoy traveling to the U.S. is murdered and a stash of jewels owned by White Russians is missing, Eleanor must assess the motives of privileged passengers, including a Russian ballerina emigree, and such real-life characters as Charles Lindbergh, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Benny, Henry Luce, Josephine Baker and a young John F.

Binjamin Wilkomirski was a child when the round-ups of Jews in Latvia began. His father was killed in front of him, he was separated from his family, and, perhaps three or four years old, he found himself in Majdanek death camp, surrounded by strangers. In piercingly simple scenes Wilkomirski gives us the "fragments" of his recollections, so that we too become small again and see this bewildering, horrifying world at child's eye-height. No adult interpretations intervene. From inside the mind of a little boy we too experience love and loss, terror and friendship, and the final arduous return to the "real" world. Beautifully written, with an indelible impact that makes this a book that is not read but experienced, <b>Fragments</b> is "a masterpiece" (Kirkus Reviews). Translated form the German by Carol Brown Janeway.<br><br>"This sunning and austerely written work is so profoundly moving, so morally important, and so free from literary artifice of any kind at all that I wonder if I even have the right to try to offer praise."--Jonathan Kozol, The Nation</p><p>Binjamin Wilkomirski (the name the author believes to be his, though he will never know for sure) was held in a Nazi concentration camp in Poland as a young child. <i>Fragments</i> contains the powerful remnants of his memory, the piercing shards of a child's recollections of unadulterated terror and the confusing horror of the camps. The sheer power of the author's story would be sufficient to explain the force of his words; his steady confidence in his childlike voice and memory adds even greater authority to this memoir. Capable of standing up against Elie Wiesel's harrowing masterpiece <i>Night</i>, <i>Fragments</i> evokes an awesome power through the memory of a child and the words of a courageously honest man who has refused to substitute "understanding" for the inexplicable events he experienced.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Great Divide</h2><p>As they begin, the sky is full of competitors in balloons, yet as the race goes on, more and more drop out and soon everyone begins to wonder if anyone will be able to make it to the finish line.</p><p>Dayle Ann Dodds is a former elementary school teacher with a degree in early childhood development. As she does in THE GREAT DIVIDE, Dayle Ann Dodds often writes in rhyme because "it is so natural to kids' ears. Rhyme, rhythm, and pattern help kids remember small revelations in entertaining stories," she says. Embedded in the exciting contest of THE GREAT DIVIDE, readers will find grouping, adding, subtracting, and multiplying, and discover how they form the foundation of division. Dayle Ann Dodds lives in Palo Alto, California.<br><br>Tracy Mitchell was born in Boston but grew up in New Orleans, a city whose influence is evident in her art style. THE GREAT DIVIDE is Tracy Mitchell's first picture book, and she says that working with such a large number of characters was just one of the many challenges she faced in creating her paintings for the book. "Dividing the racers into crazy groups, like clowns, pirates, and dancers, definitely helped," she says. Tracy Mitchell lives in Somerville, Massachusetts.In this crafty story of a cross-country race called "The Great Divide," numerical division accounts for the narrowing of the field. Eighty costumed competitors (in 10 groups of eight) begin the event on bicycles, but only half of them ford a rocky red canyon to continue: "On with the race./ Head for a boat!/ Forty racers now have to float!" These 40 (now 10 groups of four) climb aboard two big rowboats, and a whirlpool diminishes their number by half again. Dodds (Sing, Sophie!) continues reducing the group to 10 and to five, at which point "one runner stops with a rock in her shoe," enabling the final four to grab tandem bikes. The author demonstrates rather than describes the math, and her terse rhymes reinforce the racers' sense of urgency. Meanwhile Mitchell's individualized portraits of the athletes raise the book's quotient of pleasure. The illustrator, making a notable picture-book debut, carefully includes the dwindling number of eight clowns, eight cowhands, eight flappers, eight pirates and so on in her well-organized acrylic paintings; aspiring number crunchers can count the participants with ease. Among the top contenders, likable characters emerge: a jailbird wears a determined grin, a grandmotherly lady rides a galloping horse and a firefighter sticks out her tongue in exhaustion. All lessons should be this gratifying. Ages 5-10.

His focus is strategic rather than tactical, scanning the emergence of secret intelligence policy before and during WW I, the intelligence response to the Bolshevik Revolution, undercover operations between world wars against the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and the invaluable work of the Security Service (MI5) and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) during WW II. A parade of remarkable and sometimes notorious figures marches vividly throughout these lively pages, including Mansfield Cumming, in whose honor the present head of MI6 is still known as "C" (not "M," as in Ian Fleming's novels), master spy Sidney Reilly and Soviet double agent Kim Philby. But the dominating figure, surprisingly, is Winston Churchill, whose faith in and fascination for secret intelligence manifested itself fruitfully from his tenure as home secretary before World War I to his days as prime minister in World War II. A masterful work. January<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.This lengthy but wonderfully detailed and researched book describing the emergence of the British intelligence community (MI5, SIS, and all that) could not come at a more opportune time. Never mind that it is replete with pilot plots for a rich Masterpiece Theatre series, it has a lot to say about intelligence services, ideological politics, spy mania (real, fictional, and imagined), national character, and bureaucracy. For American readers, Andrew's tale, and his wise remarks on accountability, are sobering. Who, after all, watches the watchman of the secrets? Who in fact are these watchmen and what is their character and allegiance? Andrew's interesting work guarantees that the "great game" will never seem the same again.

Upon arrival in Edinburgh, Sam is amazed by the thousands of quirky inventions that the professor created in his fantastic home and learns about his host's intriguing past. Thirty-five years earlier, the professor and six colleagues had attempted to create the world's greatest university on an island nation called Nordbergen in the Arctic. One of them was evil Professor Murdo, who kidnapped his colleagues and left them to die. Fortunately, his plan didn't work. Unfortunately for Sam and the siblings, Professor Murdo's henchmen appear and again kidnap the six good professors, who have gathered at Ampersand's because of rumors of Murdo's reemergence. The children have only three days to rescue the professors and save the human race. Side stories involving Marcia Slick and her dreadful parents, who have paid a fortune to Nordbergen Research Enterprises to turn her into the perfect daughter, and several teenagers who aid Sam, Ben, and Zara culminate with the infiltration of the children into Murdo's lair. Comic relief is provided by Ampersand's cranky neighbor, who speaks in colorful Scots language. Action is nonstop and very exciting. This inventive, funny, suspenseful, and exciting book will appeal to most readers, especially fans of Dahl and Rowling.<i>&#x2013;B.

Creating cakes and pastries under Chef Nischan&#x2019;s direction was exhilarating, and it was clear at age twenty-five that I had found my calling; the<i> New York Times</i> raved about my desserts, calling them &#x201c;breathtaking in both artistry and taste.&#x201d;<br><br> From there, I worked in turn as a caterer, restaurant manager, and cake designer, creating custom cakes for weddings, birthdays, and other gala events, and opened Sublime Bakery, a retail bakery and cake studio in Fort Worth. From its inception, Sublime stood at the forefront of custom cakes, incorporating organic ingredients before they were mainstream and championing gluten-free, vegan, and sugar-free baked goods before they became trendy. It came to be known as the place to turn to if your kiddo had a laundry list of allergies; we would always find a way to make a cake or cupcakes for them.&nbsp;<br><br> My dearest Sublime memory is of a sweet little boy named Jack; he was four when he first came in with his mom and his big brother, Pete. Pete explained that Jack had never had a &#x201c;real&#x201d; cupcake from a bakery because of his numerous food allergies and intolerances. Jack&#x2019;s mom had heard that we baked cupcakes that were gluten free and vegan, so they had come to check it out. Jack&#x2019;s eyes grew huge when I handed him a chocolate cupcake straight from our pastry case. This was a totally new experience for him; in the past, he&#x2019;d always had to do without when the family got treats at a bakery. But he didn&#x2019;t hesitate for a second&#x2014;he just dived right in, face first. His joy was as pure as anything I&#x2019;ve ever witnessed.<br><br> Little did I know that I, too, would soon need to eliminate all gluten from my diet. It happened when I was a con-testant on the <i>Food Network Challenge, </i>where<i> </i>I quickly became known as the contestant who always goes big: on the wedding cake show, I created one of the tallest cakes in <i>Food Network Challenge</i> history&#x2014;seven feet three inches tall, to be exact. But during my fourth appearance, in the midst of preparing yet another big cake&#x2014;a five-foot-tall <i>Tyrannosaurus rex </i>cake&#x2014;I experienced a painful tingling and paralysis in my hands. I was simply unable to complete my cake before the competition buzzer went off. The diagnosis: rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors prescribed a lifelong regime of toxic medications and painkillers, but I did my own research and, through trial and error, created a program for myself to heal my body and control the debilitating symptoms&#x2014;which included eliminating food triggers like dairy, refined sugar, and, yes, gluten from my diet. Soon after, I enrolled in the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, where I became certified as a wellness coach so I could help others suffering from chronic illnesses.&nbsp;<br><br> My diagnosis&#x2014;and the miraculous relief that the elimination of gluten and dairy provided&#x2014;inspired me to develop gluten-free (and dairy-free) versions of all my favorite cakes. My goal was to create cakes and cupcakes that would be every bit as good as the originals.&nbsp;<br> So I invite you, and everyone you know with gluten sensitivities or food allergies, to grab a fork and a slice of cake and dig in with gusto. Because we all deserve to have our cake&#x2014;and eat it, too! I hope you&#x2019;ll enjoy baking, decorating, and eating my gluten-free cakes as much as I&#x2019;ve enjoyed creating them.<br><br>-------------------------------------<br><br>This beautiful Bundt was the first cake I hoped to make deliciously gluten free. <br> I began by layering in the lemon flavor, using fresh juice and zest in both the <br> batter and the glaze. Don&#x2019;t even think about using bottled juice here: the fresh flavor, aroma, and oils of fresh lemon are crucial to the success of this cake.<br><br> <b>Lemon Blueberry Bundt <br> </b>with Glistening Lemon Glaze<br><br><b>Lemony Blueberry Bundt</b><br> 3 cups Gluten-Free Whole Grain Flour Blend (page 191)<br> 2 teaspoons baking powder&nbsp;<br> 2 teaspoons xanthan gum<br> � teaspoon fine sea salt<br> 1 cup milk or unsweetened coconut milk (from a carton), <br> at room temperature&nbsp;<br> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon organic lemon zest&nbsp;<br> 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter or Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks, at room temperature<br> 2 cups organic cane sugar&nbsp;<br> 2 eggs or Flax Egg Replacer (page 194), at room temperature<br> 1 cup frozen organic blueberries<br><br> <b>Glistening Lemon Glaze</b><br> � cup freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped organic lemon zest<br> 4 to 6 tablespoons confectioners&#x2019; sugar (to make your own, see page 192)&nbsp;<br><br> Preheat the oven to 350�F. Lightly oil a 10-inch-diameter Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray or coconut oil.<br><br> To make the cake: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour blend, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt. In a small bowl, mix the milk with the lemon juice and zest. Set both bowls aside.<br><br> Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl and beat again for 15 seconds. Add the sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy, 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl and beat for 15 seconds. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for 20 seconds and scraping down the bowl after each addition. Add the milk mixture to the batter and mix on low for 30 seconds, and then on medium for 30 seconds. The batter will look separated at this point.<br><br> With the mixer running on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, about 1 cup at a time. Scrape down the bowl after the second and third additions. When all the flour has been added, mix on medium speed for 30 seconds. <br><br>Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the blueberries using a rubber spatula.<br> Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until the cake <br> is light golden brown and set to the touch. (Don&#x2019;t use a toothpick test: this cake is very moist, and the blueberries may make the toothpick appear wet when the cake is actually done.) Transfer the cake in its pan to a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes.<br><br> Meanwhile, make the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, and confectioners&#x2019; sugar. Use the smaller amount of sugar for a thinner glaze, and the larger amount if you want it thicker.&nbsp;<br><br> When the cake is cool to the touch, remove the cake from the pan to cool on a wire rack set over a parchment-lined baking sheet, referring to page 172 for guidance if necessary. When completely cool, pour the glaze over the top of the cake.<br> Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 to 2 days or in the refrigerator for 5 to 7 days. Or you can freeze it, tightly wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap, up to 2 months; thaw at room temperature before removing the plastic and serving.</p><h2>Derailed (Windy City Neightbors: Thorndike Press Large Print Christian Fiction)</h2><p>A humorous, contemporary tale in an urban setting introduces Harry Bentley, who sees his second chance for a better life thrown into turmoil when his son and grandson need to move into his home on Beecham Street--a typical, isolated, distrustful American neighborhood--where an accident occurs that changes everyone.

He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned.</p><p>Plutarch wrote on many subjects.

Here Mary has spent thirty-five years, devoting herself to her sister, now dead, and to her father, Canon Jocelyn. Although she is pitied by her neighbours for this muted existence, Mary is content. But when she meets Robert Herbert, Mary&#39;s ease is destroyed and years of suppressed emotion surface through her desire for him. First published in 1924 this novel is an impressive exploration of Mary&#39;s relationship with her father, of her need for Robert and the way in which, through each, she comes to a clearer understanding of love.</p><p>Flora Macdonald Mayor was born in 1872 and read history at Cambridge. Five of her novels have been published, one posthumously, and a collection of stories for children. But it is this novel, published in 1913 and THE RECTOR&#39;S DAUGHTER, published in 1924 which best express her artistic genius. After life-long ill-health she died in 1932.<b>The Rector's daughter</b>, Mary Jocelyn, is "a decline... as much a part of her village as its homely hawthorns." Mary's mother is long dead, her brothers have both left England, and Ruth, her sick sister, requires constant care. Her father, Canon Jocelyn "rather despise[s] the rest of Europe" and is "an austere critic of young women, demanding little of them in action, but everything in repose." Mary's few acquaintances are old family friends to whom she feels more obligation than true affection and, try as she might to deny it, she knows all tenderness in her father died with her mother. Now a middle-aged spinster, Mary is used to being lonely, but she cannot stop longing for love. Then Mr. Herbert, the son of her father's old friend, moves into the neighborhood. Slowly, surely and without intention on either one's part, love blossoms. Love so strong that Mary cannot speak of it or control her blissful fantasies. When Mr. Herbert leaves for the seashore to recover from a chill, they both believe he will return to ask for Mary's hand in marriage. An elegantly written and scathingly honest account of society, manners, and marriage, <b>The Rector's Daughter</b> is a fiercely passionate and quietly tender story of love and loss. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Swords In The Mist (The Third Book of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser)</h2><p>Fafhrd and Gray Mouser visit the Witch&#39;s Tent to consult a sorceress who holds the secret to their escape-but when would they ever need to escape?

FORRESTER?"</p> <p>Seeing Kayla's teacher smile expectantly as she held the door, Angela swallowed hard, then straightened her spine and walked into the sixth-grade classroom. On the Friday afternoon before Christmas break, it was empty of students, yet it still smelled of pencil shavings and chalk, which evoked pleasant associations. Growing up, Angela had been a good student. But the girl she'd taken in a year earlier was struggling in school, in life.</p> <p>Angela had become Kayla's caregiver so late, could she really make any difference?</p> <p>That was the big question and had been from the beginning. Angela was afraid she couldn't. And she was afraid Kayla's teacher had called her in, once again, to let her know just how badly she was failing.</p> <p>Trying to ignore the helplessness that engulfed her so often lately, Angela perched uncomfortably on the chair next to Mrs. Bennett's battle-scarred desk&#x2014;she knew her place in this room well&#x2014;and smoothed the skirt of the designer suit she'd worn to work that morning. "I'm sorry to bother you again," the teacher began, peering at Angela over her bifocals.</p> <p>Angela pulled her heavy trench coat more tightly around her and forced a smile. "It's fine. You know I want what's best for Kayla."</p> <p>"I want the same thing."</p> <p>"Of course." They just approached it differently. Mrs. Bennett could be stern and rather severe. She often indicated that she felt Angela was letting pity about what had happened in the past interfere with good old-fashioned discipline. But Angela had been a foster child herself&#x2014;had spent several years living in the same house as Kayla's mother, in fact&#x2014;so she understood Kayla's situation well. Besides, this was Angela's first attempt at parenting. She was twenty-nine, but she wasn't married. Maybe she wasn't the best person in the world to finish raising Stephanie's daughter, but before Stephanie's mother had died, she'd given Angela guardianship because she was a better choice than any of Kayla's other options.</p> <p>"What seems to be the problem, Mrs. Bennett?" She decided to ask the question and get it over with.</p> <p>"Isn't Kayla turning in her assignments?"</p> <p>Angela knew Kayla finished her homework because they did it together. But only last Wednesday Mrs. Bennett had informed Angela that it'd been two weeks since Kayla had handed in a single paper. Angela had been shocked and worried, of course, but what made the situation more mystifying was the fact that Kayla couldn't tell her <i>why </i>she wasn't turning in the work.</p> <p>"She's improving there," Mrs. Bennett said. "I'd like to see her test scores come up, but that's another issue. I called you in today because I wanted you to see something she's written."</p> <p>Written? The crisp Denver winter settled a little deeper into Angela's bones. Kayla was generally excluded from the tight cliques of other girls. She kept to herself and rarely associated with the kids in her class, which had been the subject of yet another parent/teacher conference. So...had Kayla finally decided to get even with the ever-popular but cruel Barbie Hanover, who'd stolen her notebook and shown Jordan Wheeler the poem she'd composed about him?</p> <p>Angela half expected Mrs. Bennett to smooth out a note detailing Barbie's lack of good qualities or some other manifestation of the intense humiliation she'd caused Kayla. But Mrs. Bennett presented her with what looked like a regular English paper. And, even more surprisingly, written across the top in red ink was a big fat A.</p> <p>It was probably Kayla's first A, which should've been reason to celebrate. Except Mrs. Bennett's sober expression indicated that Angela should still be concerned.</p> <p>"What&#x2014;"</p> <p>"Read it," Mrs. Bennett said. Angela glanced at the heading.</p> <p>All I Want For Christmas By Kayla ???????</p> <p>"She wouldn't put her last name?" Angela asked in confusion.</p> <p>Mrs. Bennett gestured that Angela should keep reading.</p> <p>She returned her attention to the small, cramped writing.</p> <p>I suppose you want to hear that Christmas is my favorite time of year. That's what everyone else says, right? There's candy and presents and parties. There's baby Jesus and Santa Claus. Even for girls like me.</p> <p>So why am I finding this stupid paper so hard to write? I should just copy someone else, someone normal. I can hear the people all around me. I want this...I want that...I'm getting a new cell phone, a new TV, a new dress. Barbie sits next to me and wants an iPod. Not any old iPod. It has to hold about a billion songs and play videos, too. Nothing but the best for Barbie, and we all know she'll get it. Her friend Sierra is asking for a snowboard. That's not cheap, either, so I wouldn't ask for it even if I wanted it. But Sierra's parents are rich, which means she'll be pleasantly NOT surprised to find it under the tree on Christmas morning. They're lucky. Not because they get what they want, but because they want what they get. A boy I know wants a new basketball. He's&#x2014;<i>the next part had been heavily erased and written over</i>&#x2014;He's even luckier.</p> <p>Was Kayla writing about Jordan at this point? Angela wondered. She thought so. He was the only person not named, which was significant, and there was emotion behind all those eraser marks.</p> <p>Angela frowned and kept reading.</p> <p>Tyler Jameson is asking for an Xbox. <i>Tyler was Jordan's best friend, which seemed to offer more proof that she'd segued from the boy she liked to his best friend.</i> He's always making a list of the games he wants&#x2014;at $60 apiece. His Christmas isn't going to be cheap. Money. I wish it could buy what I want. I wish I could be satisfied with an iPod or new clothes, or even getting my ears pierced. But I don't care about any of that. I want something Santa can't pull out of a sack. I want a real last name. The kind that came before I did. Not, "We'll just call her..." I want to know what my name should've been. I want to know who I belong to. I want my father. Then I could ask him why he loved my mother enough to make me but didn't love me enough to stay.</p> <p>If I knew him, I think even I could be happy with an iPod.</p> <p>By the time she finished, Angela's throat had constricted and she doubted she could speak. She didn't know what to say, anyway. As tears filled her eyes, she felt Mrs. Bennett's hand close over hers.</p> <p>"Heart-wrenching, isn't it?" she said softly. Surprised at the empathy in the teacher's voice, Angela nodded. Evidently Mrs. Bennett wasn't quite as stern as she appeared. But Angela wasn't sure why she'd called her in to read this essay. Angela couldn't give Kayla what she wanted. Kayla's father didn't even know she was alive&#x2014;and, because of what had happened thirteen years ago, Angela couldn't tell him. This letter only made her feel worse because now she knew that nothing she could buy Kayla for Christmas would make the girl any happier.</p> <p>"She's a...a deep child," Angela managed to say.</p> <p>"She understands what really matters." Angela sensed that Mrs. Bennett had more to say, but the teacher wasn't quite as direct as usual. She seemed to choose her next words carefully. "You've already shared with me the situation that motivated you to take her in. Have you heard from her mother lately?"</p> <p>"Not for a few months." Angela had had little contact with her friend since Stephanie had turned to prostitution in order to support her drug habit.Angela had tracked her down a number of times and tried to get her off the streets. She'd planned to put her in yet another drug rehab center. But during their last encounter, Stephanie had spent one night with them, stolen all the money out of Angela's purse and disappeared before she and Kayla could get up in the morning. Without so much as a goodbye or an "I love you" for Kayla.</p> <p>The incident had upset Kayla so much that Angela had decided she didn't want to see Stephanie again. She had to let go of the mother in order to save the daughter. Which was why she was selling her house. She couldn't have Stephanie dropping in on them whenever she felt like it, disrupting Kayla's life. Kayla had refused to come out of her room for nearly three weeks after the last visit.</p> <p>"You've never mentioned her father," Mrs. Bennett said. "Do you know anything about him?"</p> <p>"I'm afraid not," Angela lied.</p> <p>"Do you think a little research might help? Even if the circumstances surrounding Kayla's birth weren't good, the information might assuage the terrible hunger I sense in her through these words&#x2014;and in some of her other behavior, as well."</p> <p>Angela sensed that hunger, too. But telling Kayla about her father would start a chain reaction that could disrupt, possibly ruin, a lot of lives. Besides, Angela had promised Kayla's late grandmother&#x2014;the woman who'd provided a foster home for Angela after her parents died&#x2014;that she would <i>never </i>tell.</p> <p>"There's no way to find him," she said. "I've tried."</p> <p>"Recently? Because now that we have the Internet&#x2014;"</p> <p>"It was a one-night stand. Her mother didn't even know his name." Another lie, but Mrs. Bennett seemed to buy it.</p> <p>"I see." She shook her head. "I'm sorry to hear that."</p> <p>"It's unfortunate." The whole thing was unfortunate&#x2014;and only one person was to blame.</p> <p>"Okay, well, we'll continue to do what we can to make Kayla feel loved, won't we? Thanks for coming in. I hope you both have a wonderful Christmas."</p> <p>"Same to you," Angela said and stood as if nothing had changed. But a thought she'd had several times in the past was stealing up on her. What if she were to take Kayla back to Virginia City for a visit? It'd been thirteen years. Surely, Matthew Jackson would never guess after so long. It would give Angela a chance to assess the situation, determine where Matt was now, what he was doing&#x2014;and whether or not there was any chance he might be receptive to such a shocking secret.</p></p><h2>The Sewing Workshop: Learn to Sew with 30+ Easy, Pattern-Free Projects</h2><p>Welcome to <i>The Sewing Workshop</i>, filled cover-to-cover with projects from three of our most popular sewing box sets.

He was the first writer to successfully merge realism with genre fiction, and by so doing I think he may actually have created the kind of popular fiction that drove the best-seller lists and lit up the American imagination in the years 1960 to 2000. Books as disparate as <em>The New Centurions</em>, <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em>, <em>The Godfather</em>, <em>Black Sunday</em>, and <em>The Shining</em> all owe a debt to Evan Hunter, who taught a whole generation of baby boomers how to write stories that were not only entertaining but that truthfully reflected the times and the culture. He will be remembered for bringing the so-called "police procedural" into the modern age, but he did so much more than that. And he was one hell of a nice man. --<em>Stephen King<br><br></em>Way back in the mid-1970s, when I was a new writer and police series were very big, my editor asked me to do a series called <em>Joe Ryker, NYPD.</em> I had no idea how to write a police detective novel, but the editor handed me a stack of books and said, &#x201c;These are the 87th Precinct novels by Ed McBain. Read them and you&#x2019;ll know everything you need to know about police novels.&#x201d; After I read the first book--which I think was <em>Let&#x2019;s Hear It for the Deaf Man</em>--I was hooked, and I read every Ed McBain I could get my hands on. Then I sat down and wrote my own detective novel, <em>The Sniper</em>, featuring Joe Ryker. My series never reached the heights of the 87th Precinct series, but by reading those classic masterpieces, I learned all I needed to know about urban crime and how detectives think and act. And I had a hell of a time learning from the master. Years later, when I actually got to meet Ed McBain/Evan Hunter, I told him this story, and he said, &#x201c;I would have liked it better if my books inspired you to become a detective instead of becoming my competition.&#x201d; Evan and I became friends, and I was privileged to know him and honored to be in his company. I remain indebted to him for his good advice over the years. But most of all, I thank him for hundreds of hours of great reading. --<em>Nelson DeMille</em> <p>To read about how Ed McBain influenced other mystery and thriller writers, visit our Perspectives on McBain page.</p> <p>For a complete selection of 87th Precinct novels available from Thomas &amp; Mercer, visit our Ed McBain's 87th Precinct Booklist.</p>Ed McBain has been the recipient of the Grand Master Award of the Mystery Writers of America.

In 1942 he fought along every foot of Kokoda as the Japanese attempted to take Port Moresby. He was the only man from his company to survive the campaign. As he was evacuated to safety he made a promise that one day he would return to his comrades and bring them home to Japan for proper burial. After the war, Nishimura prospered. But under the surface, the driving ambition of his life was to fulfil his promise. In 1979, he shocked his family by returning to New Guinea to search for the remains of Japanese soldiers. For the next 25 years, Nishimura lived alone along the Kokoda Track. Armed only with a metal detector, a mattock and a shovel, he searched for his dead comrades. Over the years he found hundreds of them - some he was able to identify and return their bones to their families; others were unknown, and their remains were sent to Japan&#39;s official shrine for its war dead in Tokyo. In 2005 Nishimura, now in his mid-eighties and seriously ill, was forced to return to Japan. His story is an incredible adventure that gives us a radically different viewpoint on a battle that has become part of our national myth. Nishimura&#39;s life and quest above all offer a poignant reminder of the futility of war.</p><p></p><h2>Classic Liners �le de France and Libert�: France&#39;s Premier Post-War Liners</h2><p><p><b>The latest in the Classic Liners series&nbsp;evokes the glamour and ambience of two of the most beloved liners of the 1950s</b> </p><p><i>�le de France</i>, completed in 1927, was a hugely famous prewar liner, a ship with unique style and character.

Lee Friedlander is the first photographer to make the car an actual "form" for making photographs. Driving across most of the country's 50 states in an ordinary rental car, Friedlander applied the brilliantly simple conceit of deploying the sideview mirror, rearview mirror, the windshield and the side windows as a picture frame within which to record the country's eccentricities and obsessions at the turn of the century. This method allows for fascinating effects in foreshortening, and wonderfully telling juxtapositions in which steering wheels, dashboards and leatherette bump up against roadside bars, motels, churches, monuments, suspension bridges, landscapes and often Friedlander's own image, via sideview mirror shots. Presented in the square crop format that has dominated his look in recent series, and taken over the past decade, the nearly 200 images in <i>America by Car</i> are easily among Friedlander's finest, full of virtuoso touch and clarity, while also revisiting themes from older bodies of work (Friedlander occasionally used aspects of automotive architecture in photographs from the late 1960s and early 1970s). Never has America been photographed so penetratingly and ingeniously as in Friedlander's latest body of work.</p><p>Lee Friedlander is 76 and has published at least one photography book every year since before many of us were born. Judging from his latest, &#34;America by Car,&#34; he still has a lot left in his tank. The book shows how our views of the landscapes outside our cars--from our boulevards of strip malls to our national parks--are warped by, and inseparable from, the windows and struts inside. Mr. Friedlander&#39;s camera reminds us what a weird and hilarious world we are ignoring most of the time. --Richard Woodward, Wall Street Journal, December 16, 2010</p><h2>Fox&#39;s Book of Martyrs - A History of the Lives, Sufferings and Triumphant Deaths of the Early Christian and Protestant Martyrs</h2><p>This vintage work contains a detailed treatise on the early Christian and Protestant martyrs, with information on their history and lives.

It seemed ideal; pick up a puppy on Friday, return it on Sunday night, get a new puppy each year. No strings attached. Well, it turns out there were strings &#x2013; and they tugged at her every time she had to return &#x201c;her dog&#x201d; to its weekday caregiver.<br> <br>This memoir chronicles Sharron&#x2019;s year co-parenting Daisy, a sweet Lab puppy, with Keith, Daisy&#x2019;s other trainer. As Sharron and Keith develop a relationship she likens to &#x201c;divorced parents handing over the kids,&#x201d; she becomes curious about Keith&#x2019;s life story. When Sharron uncovers a tragic event from Keith&#x2019;s past, she realizes she must take a lesson from Daisy and &#x201c;think like a dog&#x201d;&#x2014; react to circumstances in the present, not the past.<br> <br>Sharron applies this way of thinking at home too, using the lessons she learned from Daisy to mend her rocky relationship with her teenage daughter. Where once a dramatic eye roll from her daughter would have sparked a battle, Sharron has learned to employ the patience and understanding she practices with Daisy to become a better mom.

I distinctly remember keeping a respectful distance as he described his role as a volunteer puppy raiser, even if it did require I clasp my hands behind my back to physically restrain myself from patting the dog.<br> <br>If it had been a few years earlier&#x2014;when Tucker was still alive, the kids little, and my in-laws healthy&#x2014;I wouldn&#x2019;t have reacted so strongly to the sight of the dog. Sure, I would have been curious, but my mild social anxiety would have kept me from speaking up. Instead, I would have strolled by as many times as it took to make out the words on the dog&#x2019;s vest before retreating back to my shopping list. But on that day, I was feeling desperate. I should have been content. I had a husband who loved me, a good job, two healthy, relatively happy children. But I couldn&#x2019;t enjoy being with my family that day because the fact that the four of us were together only underscored how rare an occurrence that had become. Our kids were growing out of childhood and pulling me grudgingly along with them. Soon enough, they would be grown and gone, and with them, much of what defined me for the past decade and a half. Without them, I&#x2019;d have to somehow figure out who I would be next. The sight of the dog offered if not the answer to my fears of the future, a pleasant diversion from them. And at the very least, a possible cure for my CDD.<br> <br>The man unloaded his groceries onto the belt as he described the National Education for Assistance Dog Services (NEADS), which trains service dogs. I&#x2019;d heard of NEADS, had even covered one of its graduations years earlier when I was a newspaper reporter. But back then, NEADS only trained dogs to alert their hearing-impaired owners to sounds like alarm clocks and crying babies. I hadn&#x2019;t realized that in the years since, it had expanded its mission to train dogs to assist with a range of disabilities: multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, autism, post-traumatic stress disorder. There really was no limit to whom the dogs could help.<br> <br>These days, most of their puppies are trained by inmates in prisons and released on weekends to volunteers like the man in the supermarket, who by now had pulled out his wallet to pay the cashier. I said good-bye and he urged me to visit the NEADS website to learn more. I returned to my daughter, who was lurking two lanes away, pretending to study the cover of Diabetic Living.<br> <br>THAT EVENING AFTER dinner, I settled in front of my computer and clicked around on the NEADS website until I found the page for the Prison Pup Partnership. I learned that NEADS places puppies in select prisons throughout New England, where inmates train them to be assistance dogs. The inmate dog handlers have the most coveted job in prison. In exchange for raising and training a puppy, they get three dollars a day and their own cell to share with their dog. Over the course of twelve months or so, these specially chosen inmates are responsible for housebreaking their puppies and teaching them basic obedience before moving on to more specialized tasks with help from a professional trainer: teaching their dogs to pick up dropped coins, turn light switches on and off, push elevator buttons with their noses, get the phone when it rings, open and close doors, and fetch items from a refrigerator. Because inmates have all the time in the world to devote to their jobs, they&#x2019;re able to train their dogs in about half the time it would take a professional dog trainer, and at significantly reduced cost.<br> <br>There is one problem, though, and it&#x2019;s kind of a big one. Assistance dogs go everywhere with their owners, so they need to be confident in all situations. If all a dog knows is prison, it won&#x2019;t be able to function in the outside world. Things we take for granted&#x2014;such as phones ringing, couples hugging, cars, and kids&#x2014;are likely to send the dog into a barking frenzy or scrambling for the nearest hiding place. This is where weekend puppy raisers come in. On Friday afternoons, each puppy is furloughed into the custody of a volunteer who brings the dog along on errands and outings all weekend long, exposing it to new situations and continuing its training until Sunday evening, when the volunteer returns the puppy to prison.<br> <br>The application to be a weekend puppy raiser was on the website. I skimmed the questions, looking for anything that might immediately disqualify me. There weren&#x2019;t any requests for documentation of an advanced degree in canine behavior modification, no trick questions asking whether I&#x2019;d interrupt my dinner to reward a begging puppy with (a) table scraps or (b) a slab of deli meat from the fridge. The questions were straightforward. How many adults in your household? (Two, if you count me.) How many children and what are their ages? (Fifteen and eleven, but growing up too fast. Sometimes not fast enough.) Any pets? (Two bunnies that live in a hutch outside.) NEADS wanted to know about our house and yard. I described our location in a semirural Massachusetts suburb, emphasizing the total lack of traffic on our cul-de-sac. Then I came to the question &#x201c;Why do you want to raise a NEADS puppy?&#x201d;<br> <br>I closed my eyes and thought about it. Long before Tucker was our dog, she was my aspiration. As a kid, I&#x2019;d begged for a dog, threatened to run away if I didn&#x2019;t get one, bargained, cajoled, and whined (a lot). My mother&#x2019;s answer was always the same: &#x201c;When you have your own house, you can have a dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was worth the wait. Marty and I moved into our first home in the month of June and took Tucker, a pudgy eight-week-old puppy with an outsize personality, home in September. We found her in the classifieds of the local newspaper, the product of a secret rendezvous between neighboring German shepherds.<br> <br>Tucker lived for nearly fifteen years. During that time, I had two babies and figured out how to be a mother. The Tucker years coincided with&#x2014;and influenced&#x2014;all of those thrilling firsts: first steps (my daughter was a late walker because of the constant threat of being knocked off her feet); first words (&#x201c;Tu&#x201d; for both of my kids); the first day of kindergarten (Tucker rode in the backseat while I followed the school bus at what I hoped was a discreet distance). There isn&#x2019;t a home video from those years that doesn&#x2019;t include at least one furry eclipse or scene-blocking shot of Tucker&#x2019;s snout and an off-camera voice yelling, &#x201c;Tucker! Move!&#x201d;<br> <br>Throughout the changes wrought by parenthood, Tucker was a reassuring constant. She kept us anchored to routine amid the chaos of kids and work. Every morning, Tucker and I went together for a forty-minute walk through the woods behind our house. I&#x2019;d stand in the kitchen and call out, &#x201c;Where are my boots?&#x201d; running the words together so they came out as a single burst of sound. Tucker would push her snout through the kitty door to the basement, trying to reach the ledge by the stairs where I kept my shoes. She would dart forward, pretend-biting my hands while I sat on the floor to lace them up, and race back and forth through the kitchen until I opened the back door. Then she&#x2019;d streak outside, disappear through the trees, and wait on the path until I caught up. We did this every day, even when our walk was a slog through rain or snow or I had to wrap a scarf around my face to keep my skin from freezing in the cold.<br> <br>I felt safe with Tucker. I worked for a newspaper, and when I was transferred to the early-morning copy desk and we had to start our walks in the predawn darkness, Tucker would stay close to me while I focused the beam of the flashlight downward to illuminate roots and rocks, feeling as much as seeing the shadows pulse inward on either side of us. I&#x2019;d draw comfort from Tucker&#x2019;s steady panting and the sound of twigs snapping beneath our feet, feeling protected by my dog and the noise we made together.<br> <br>When I was a teenager, I brought three things with me whenever I had to walk anywhere alone: a jackknife that I discovered half-buried in the dirt outside my school; a rock that fit in the palm of my hand but was heavy enough to use against an attacker; and a small, carved wooden lion that my mother gave me after my father moved out and which she said would give me strength. There was no specific reason for me to be fearful, just an awareness that sometimes awful things happened and one should be prepared as best she could. It didn&#x2019;t help that I was small. Even now I&#x2019;m sometimes mistaken for an eleven-year-old from behind. With Tucker, I didn&#x2019;t need a rock or a knife or a wooden lion. She was my talisman, my weapon, and my protector. But mostly, she was my dog.<br> <br>As the kids grew up, Tucker grew old. The moment of her death was quick and painless, but the months leading up to it were excruciating for her and for us. Our dog, who in her younger years had so much energy that I suspected someone had secretly implanted springs in her feet, would struggle to stand up, then collapse as her legs buckled under her weight. She was incontinent and, I&#x2019;m pretty sure, heartbreakingly ashamed of it.<br> <br>Every night I&#x2019;d kiss the top of her head right between her ears, and in the morning I&#x2019;d reach over the side of the bed and touch her body lightly with my hand until I felt it rise and fall with her breath. My relief at having my dog still with me would fade, though, at the thought of her suffering through another day.<br> <br>Eventually, Marty and I accepted that it was up to us to stop Tucker&#x2019;s suffering. She was at the end of her life. We had to let her go. I called the vet and arranged to bring Tucker after the weekend, on a Monday. That gave me time to tell her everything I needed to say to her. For those three days, I&#x2019;d lie on the floor next to her and reminisce about her puppyhood, my panic on the first ride home when she wouldn&#x2019;t stop yelping and crying because she missed her mother and siblings, how lucky we felt to find her, out of all the dogs in the world. I thanked her for preparing me and Marty to be parents, for protecting me and the children, for being our dog.<br> <br>Marty came home from work early that Monday and we gave the kids time to say good-bye. They cried a little, then drifted off to read or play. Tucker was their parents&#x2019; dog more than theirs.<br> <br>At the vet, Tucker used her last bit of strength to snap at the technician. I was silently proud that my dog was going out fighting. Plus, it was entirely in character for her. Tucker loved going to the vet but hated the exam table. Every time we took her there for shots or a physical, she would race up the steps into the waiting room and greet everyone there with her tail wagging, but the moment we got her on the table, she&#x2019;d transform from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde and start snarling and nipping&#x2014;and out would come the muzzle. This time would be no different. The vet, a stony-faced but kind woman, apologized when she handed us the blue cloth muzzle and waited while Marty slipped it over Tucker&#x2019;s nose. While the vet injected our dog with pentobarbital, Marty and I took turns whispering into Tucker&#x2019;s ear that she was a good dog, a smart dog, the best pal ever, until the vet removed the muzzle so that, in those last moments, we could stroke Tucker&#x2019;s nose and kiss the spot between her eyes and scratch behind her ears, which we did until we realized there was no longer life beneath our touch.<br> <br>Marty, whose decades as a journalist taught him the value of gallows humor in times of tragedy, took a long, wavering breath and said between sobs, &#x201c;Oh, Tucker! You always knew this place would be the death of you.&#x201d; The vet&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change but the technician laughed nervously. I put my arms around Marty, shaking from laughter and sobs.<br> <br>Back home, I washed Tucker&#x2019;s dishes and stored them in the basement. I used pliers to pry the tags from her collar, then attached them to a long chain and wore them around my neck. The following weekend, Marty and I picked out new carpet. I allowed myself to appreciate the luxury of not worrying about getting home in time to let the dog out even as I hated opening the door to an empty house.<br> <br>Friends wanted to know when we were going to adopt another dog. We&#x2019;d tell them maybe someday, but for now we wanted to enjoy our new carpets. Of course that was a lie. Marty always worried about our tight finances and wanted a break from the vet bills. And I didn&#x2019;t want to start over with a new pet because a dog&#x2019;s limited years on earth were an uncomfortable reminder of our own. As all endings do, Tucker&#x2019;s death forced me to look back on my past and forward to my future. Behind me was a life that spilled over with the busyness of a growing family. In front of me, I saw that same family getting older until, in less than half the span of a dog&#x2019;s natural life, the kids would be off on their own, and it would be just me and Marty left at home.<br> <br>Oh, crap. I was crying. I swiped my eyes and stared at the question on the computer screen. Why did I want to raise a NEADS puppy? Because I didn&#x2019;t want a dog who would grow old and die. But that&#x2019;s not what I wrote. Instead, I typed: I know firsthand how much a dog can enrich a person&#x2019;s life&#x2014;my dog was enormously important to me. And I suspect that for a person dealing with the emotional and physical challenges of a disability, a specially trained service dog enhances his or her quality of life even more. NEADS performs an invaluable service and I&#x2019;d like to be part of it.<br> <br>I read over what I&#x2019;d written and, satisfied, saved the application to my hard drive. The NEADS weekend puppy-raiser program, I naively thought, would be an ideal cure for my Canine Deficit Disorder&#x2014;pick up a puppy on Friday night, return it on Sunday night, a new puppy every year, no strings attached. I couldn&#x2019;t have been more wrong.<br> <br>MARTY WAS IN our bedroom, working out a Neil Young song on his beat-up old Yamaha guitar. His face was partially hidden behind a harmonica stand looped around his neck.

No other artist in early twentieth-century Vienna depicted the body with such radical candor as Egon Schiele. A preoccupation with Eros, sexuality, and death pervades his entire oeuvre, his insatiable curiosity and new developments in erotic and psychiatric photography driving him to explore the shift in the relationship between the visible and the invisible, the depictable and the undepictable in launching his pictorial fantasy of the bodies of men and women in general and the artist in particular. But despite the uncompromising truthfulness of his allegedly pornographic imagery, the visual enjoyment of the work of this consummate artist transcends the opposition between sensual arousal and aesthetic perception.</p><p>&#34;The books have great subjects--some of the most famous images in all art--and they have something new to say about them....&#34;</p><h2>Scenery for Model Railroads, Dioramas, &amp; Miniatures</h2><p>Transform your models from mundane to magnificent with expert proven techniques using the latest materials and methods.

But after the death of her father, everything she's ever known and loved changes in an instant.<br><br>With little skills to help provide for her family, Sienna clings to the two things that come easily--lying and stealing. But not all thief-for-hire assignments go as planned. When a covert exchange of a stolen computer chip is intercepted, she becomes entangled with a corrupt government official who uses her thieving past as leverage, her mother as collateral, and the genetically modified poster boy she's falling for as bait.<br><br>In order to rescue her mother, there may only be one option--joining forces with the Fringe, an extremist group, and their young leader who's too hot to be bad.

In Paris in 1844 he made the connection between radical philosophy and the proletariat that would guide his future work, first with the Communist League and later with the International Workingmen&#x2019;s Association. <i>Marx&#x2019;s Political Writings</i> display a profound understanding of history and politics that is still relevant to the very different conditions of today. <br><br><b>Volume 1: <i>The Revolutions of 1848</i></b>: Marx and Engels had already sketched out the principles of scientific communism by 1846. Yet it was from his intense involvement in the abortive German revolution of 1848 that Marx developed a profound practical understanding he would draw on throughout his later career. This volume includes his great call to arms&#x2014;The Communist Manifesto&#x2014;and also demonstrates Marx&#x2019;s unsuccessful attempt to spur the German bourgeoisie to decisive action against absolutism. His articles offer trenchant analyses of events in France, Poland, Prague, Berlin and Vienna, while speeches set out changing communist tactics.</p><p><b>Karl Marx</b> was born in 1818, in the Rhenish city of Trier, the son of a successful lawyer. He studied law and philosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin, completing his doctorate in 1841. In Paris three years later, Marx was introduced to the study of political economy by a former fellow student, Frederick Engels. In 1848 they collaborated in writing <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>. Expelled from Prussia in the same year, Marx took up residence first in Paris and then in London where, in 1867 he published his magnum opus <i>Capital</i>. A co-founder of the International Workingmen&#x2019;s Association in 1864, Marx died in London in 1883.<br><br><b>Tariq Ali</b> is a writer and filmmaker.

This book combines the compelling story of Jamie Tyrone - a self-proclaimed &#x201c;lab rat&#x201d; diagnosed with a 91 percent chance of contracting AD - with the medical expertise of Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, a leading authority on Alzheimer&#x2019;s and dementia.</strong></p><p>Jamie Tyrone was forty-nine years old when she learned she had a genetic predisposition toward Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease&#x2014;in fact, her genes translated to a 91 percent chance that she would contract the disease during her lifetime. Surprised by the way she learned of the diagnosis through genetic testing, and painfully familiar with Alzheimer&#x2019;s because of her family history and her experience as a nurse, Jamie felt as if she had a ticking time-bomb inside her, ready to go off at any moment.</p><p>After an initial bout with depression, Jamie decided to take action rather than concede defeat. She started by founding B.A.B.E.S (Beating Alzheimer&#x2019;s By Embracing Science) to raise money and awareness in the search for a cure. Energized by that community, Jamie teamed up with renowned neurologist Dr. Marwan Sabbagh to write <em>Fighting for My Life</em> as a practical, helpful guide for those who know they are at greater risk of contracting Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease.</p><p>This book is unique because it offers expert medical advice from Dr. Sabbagh alongside Jamie&#x2019;s real-life experiences as a woman living in the shadow of Alzheimer&#x2019;s.

Here again is Inspector Maigret, guided by humane feelings behind his stolid facade, putting himself at grave risk to arrange the escape of a condemned man from prison. Judged guilty and awaiting execution for the killing of a rich American woman, Mrs. Henderson, and her maid, Joseph Heurtin is innocent, as Maigret suspects. Unaware that the police have deliberately let him escape, Heurtin dodges about the streets, leading the inspector and his detectives to cafes where they observe their quarry's interest in Henderson's free-spending heir and the women with him, as well as Heurtin's concentration on a penniless, eccentric student. The results of Maigret's scheme are utterly unexpected. Without one unnecessary word, Simenon brings all the characters to life and keeps the reader engrossed right up to the shattering denouement. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ultimate Guide to Orgasm for Women: How to Become Orgasmic for a Lifetime</h2><p>Owning our desires should be neither embarrassing nor uncomfortable.

More than 750,000 people were butchered, and 12 million fled their homes&#x2014;primarily in caravans of bullock-carts&#x2014;to seek refuge across the new border: it was the largest exodus in history. Sixty-seven years later, it is as if that August never ended.<br><br>Renowned historian and journalist Dilip Hiro provides a riveting account of the relationship between India and Pakistan, tracing the landmark events that led to the division of the sub-continent and the evolution of the contentious relationship between Hindus and Muslims. To this day, a reasonable resolution to their dispute has proved elusive, and the Line of Control in Kashmir remains the most heavily fortified frontier in the world, with 400,000 soldiers arrayed on either side.<br><br>Since partition, there have been several acute crises between the neighbors, including the secession of East Pakistan to form an independent Bangladesh in 1971, and the acquisition of nuclear weapons by both sides resulting in a scarcely avoided confrontation in 1999 and again in 2002. Hiro amply demonstrates the geopolitical importance of the India-Pakistan conflict by chronicling their respective ties not only with America and the Soviet Union, but also with China, Israel, and Afghanistan.<br><br>Hiro weaves these threads into a lucid narrative, enlivened with colorful biographies of leaders, vivid descriptions of wars, sensational assassinations, gross violations of human rights&#x2014;and cultural signifiers like cricket matches. <i>The Longest August</i> is incomparable in its scope and presents the first definitive history of one of the world's longest-running and most intractable conflicts.<br></p><p><b>Dilip Hiro</b> is one of the world's leading experts on the Middle Eastern, Central and South Asian, and Islamic affairs.

This helps him recount the past as it happened, blemishes and all.&#x201d; <b><i>Tribune India</i></b><br><br> Hiro's book is a fluidly written narration tracing the prehistory of the conflict to Hindu assertion and Muslim anxiety as the independence struggle gathered pace.

Many of his writers are not Jewish and several were not imprisoned or interned, and yet all of them have been riven by the death-camp universe. The atrocity of that time and the atrocities that have succeeded Auschwitz represent a continuity that may almost be called a new tradition, one in which the phantasmagoric and horrific is real and the gentle and generous a prodigy to be remarked with amazement. &#34;The Holocaust and the literary Imagination is a pioneering work of criticism for it impels us, readers and writers alike, to inquire after the basic paradox: how can literature delight and transfix or warn and modify a humanity from whom nothing is hidden, nothing prohibited, for whom nothing is shocking or unreal.&#34; --Arthur A.

Living in Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan, Christopher Ransom seeks a purity and simplicity he could not find at home, and tries to exorcise the terror he encountered earlier in his travels&#x2014;a blur of violence and death at the Khyber Pass.Ransom has managed to regain control, chiefly through the rigors of karate. Supporting himself by teaching English to eager Japanese businessmen, he finds company with impresario Miles Ryder and fellow expatriates whose headquarters is Buffalo Rome, a blues-bar that satisfies the hearty local appetite for Americana and accommodates the drifters pouring through Asia in the years immediately after the fall of Vietnam.Increasingly, Ransom and his circle are threatened, by everything they thought they had left behind, in a sequence of events whose consequences Ransom can forestall but cannot change.Jay McInerney details the pattern of adventure and disillusionment that leads Christopher Ransom toward an inevitable reckoning with his fate&#x2014;in a novel of grand scale and serious implications.</p><p><b>Jay McInerney&nbsp;</b>is the author of eight novels, two collections of short stories, and three collections of essays on wine.

Home to beautiful hill towns such as Deruta, Perugia, and Assisi, plus a culinary history that dates back to the Etruscans (Italy s oldest and perhaps most fascinating civilization), Umbria rejoices in hearty dishes rooted in vegetables, legumes, grains, and farm-raised meats and redolent of herbs and bold sauces. Acclaimed cookbook author Julia della Croce takes us on a stunning visual and gastronomic tour with recipes for dishes such as Penci with Sausage, Lemon, and Nutmeg Sauce and Lorella Puccetti s Lentils with Seafood, which perfectly illustrate Umbria s simple, everyday style of cooking. Her 56 recipes are spiced with photographs of the food, the countryside, the markets, and the people, with local lore and insider tips on the best Umbria has to offer. An invitation to the heartland of Italy, Umbria is a gourmet feast for the eyes and the palate.</p><p>Julia della Croce has been distinguished as one of America's best cooking teachers by the James Beard Foundation. Her writing on authentic Italian cooking has appeared in publications such as the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Cook's Illustrated, and<br><br>John Rizzo is a photographer whose work has appeared in magazines including Bon App�tit, Wine Spectator, Life, and Food &amp; Wine.The central Italy region of Umbria offers earthy dishes heavy on black truffles and pork products, and della Croce (The Vegetarian Table: Italy) manages to do it justice in this slim cookbook that serves as a useful overview. Chapters are clearly organized but brief: a chapter on breads includes only five recipes, one of them a master recipe used in the others. First courses include soup made with the famous lentils of Castelluccio and Spaghetti alla Norcina with reconstituted dried porcini mushrooms, sweet sausage and cream. For a land-locked region, Umbria offers a surprising number of fish and shellfish dishes, using locally found items such as snails and trout from freshwater streams. Ingredients sometimes seem impractical or out of reach: Trout with Truffles calls for two black truffles. Photographs are enticing, and della Croce scatters bits of Umbrian history and folklore throughout. Her prose is awkward in places, though, and there are strange touches, like a description of ordering trota ai ferri in Todi that is, for no discernible reason, presented in the form of a letter to the author's daughters. A selection of three desserts, a recipe for hot chocolate and another for candied orange peel (not used in any of the three dessert recipes) makes for an odd finale. After an abbreviated guide to hotels and restaurants and a hazy list of local festivals, the author lists a handful of cooking schools, and takes the opportunity to plug her own classes.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Church Planter: The Man, the Message, the Mission</h2><p><p>Much of what is written about church planting aims at methodology and strategy for facing such challenges, but specific strategies do not apply to every context. What lies deeper, at the heart of<em>every</em>&nbsp;church plant?</p><p><strong>The most critical human component of every church plant is the planter.</strong></p><p>Darrin Patrick, vice president of the Acts 29 Church Planting Network, looks at what Scripture teaches about this man&#x2019;s character, his teaching, and the aim of his church. Offering guidance and wisdom from years of experience, Patrick reminds us that ultimately no church will succeed apart from a man with a message who leads a church on a mission.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This book is for every Christian leader.</strong></p><p><em>Church Planter</em>&nbsp;is an essential resource for those considering planting a church or already in such a plant, and maybe even more important for those leading an established church.&nbsp; It has wide-ranging application for elders and leadership teams seeking to better understand how the gospel must take root in their church. Avoiding an over-emphasis on particular models or methods, Patrick lays out biblical principles and sound wisdom as he urges the church to return to biblical criteria for determining the man, the message, and the mission God uses to build his church.</p></p><p><p><strong>DARRIN PATRICK</strong>&nbsp;is the vice president of the Acts 29 Church Planting Network and the founding pastor of the Journey Church in St. Louis. He has served in ministry for twenty years and speaks regularly at pastor&#x2019;s conferences and training events for church planters.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Matt Chandler</strong> is the lead pastor of The Village Church, a multi-campus church in the Dallas metroplex of over 10,000 people. His sermons are among the topselling (free) podcasts on itunes and he speaks at conferences worldwide.

He lives in Texas with his wife, Lauren, and their three children: Audrey, Reid and Norah.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a great new book on church planting that balances the personal spiritual issues with the theological, cultural, and technical. Church planters should all read this.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Timothy J. Keller</strong><strong>,</strong> Pastor, Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City; best-selling author, <em>The Reason for God</em></p><p>"<em>Church Planter</em> is an incredible tool for pastors and church planters alike that I am confident will fuel church multiplication in countless ways in the days ahead. I highly recommend this gospel-saturated challenge to plant churches led by God-centered men.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>David Platt</strong><strong>,</strong> President, International Mission Board; author, <em>Radical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream</em></p><p>&#x201c;Now here is a clever idea&#x2014;ask an experienced church-planting pastor how church planting should be done. In <em>Church Planter: The Man, the Message, the Mission</em> by Darrin Patrick, an experienced church planter speaks from deep theological conviction, pastoral experience, and missiological vision. Church planting is one of the most important movements of our era&#x2014;and one that follows the pattern set by the apostles. This book will be welcomed by all who celebrate the renaissance of church planting in this generation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>R. Albert Mohler Jr.</strong><strong>,</strong> President and Joseph Emerson Brown Professor of Christian Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;I like being pushed, and Darrin Patrick is a careful thinker and a hard-working pastor. Here he has written a clear, carefully considered, well-illustrated introduction to the pastor and his ministry. In reading it, I&#x2019;ve been challenged, provoked and encouraged. I disagree with some things, like Darrin&#x2019;s correlation between the resurrection of Christ and the transformation of cities, but this book has been exciting and helpful and I appreciate a great deal. I happily commend this book to you, and pray that God will use it to help establish churches that take the gospel of Christ to the end of the world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Mark Dever</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington DC; President, 9Marks</p><p>&#x201c;Darrin Patrick has done an amazing job detailing out what we are called to not only as church planters but as pastors and men of God. Whether you are considering planting a church or have been a pastor for decades I couldn&#x2019;t more highly recommend this book to you.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Matt Chandler</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Lead Pastor, The Village Church, Dallas, Texas; President, Acts 29 Church Planting Network; author, <em>The&nbsp;Mingling of Souls</em></p><p>&#x201c;My new friend Darrin Patrick offers an insightful look at the privilege and calling of being a church planter. As one who is passionate about growing God&#x2019;s church, I recommend this book for every pastor and church planter. If you hope to plant a church for the fame of the name of Jesus Christ, be sure to read this book before you do.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>James MacDonald</strong><strong>, </strong>Pastor, Harvest Bible Chapel, Rolling Meadows, Illinois; author, <em>Vertical Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;Darrin Patrick is an excellent thinker with a great heart for the Church.

He is widely known as a strong leader and good thinker in church planting today. In this book, Darrin brings together his biblical understanding, theological insight, and pastoral wisdom on what it takes to plant a missional church. For those who are planting or thinking about it, this book will help you to see if you are prepared&#x2014;with the message and for the mission.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Ed Stetzer</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;President, LifeWay Research; author,&nbsp;<em>Subversive Kingdom</em>; www.edstetzer.com</p><p>&#x201c;We have all read books on church planting, planting churches, and church planting movements. This book is about the church planter&#x2014;his qualifications, his theology, and his character. Make no mistake about it, Darrin Patrick covers all the bases on what it takes to be a successful church planter in the twenty-first century. Get the right man, going in the right direction, with the right message and you have impactful combination for the kingdom of God. This is a Christ- and gospel-centered approach to launching new churches.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Billy Hornsby</strong>, President, Association of Related Churches</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Church Planter: The Man, the Message, and the Mission</em> is a superb work. Darrin Patrick combines the mind of a careful theologian, the heart of a compassionate pastor, and the passion of a missional Christian. As someone heavily invested in training church planters in a seminary, this will be a must-read for those we teach and send out to penetrate lostness in the unreached and underserved cities of our nation and the world. Thank you Darren for this labor of love. You have rendered a valuable service to the body of Christ.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<strong>Daniel L.

If God has enlisted you, then read it and let the training begin!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Dave Harvey</strong><strong>,</strong> Pastor of Preaching, Four Oaks Community Church, Tallahassee, Florida; author, <em>When Sinners Say I Do</em>&nbsp;and <em>Am I Called?</em></p><p>&#x201c;I love this book because I love church planters and I know this book will help them fulfill their calling. I also love that Darrin writes in such a raw way. This isn&#x2019;t an ivory tower book. It&#x2019;s written by someone who has some battle scars because he&#x2019;s been in the trenches of church planting.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Mark Batterson</strong><strong>,</strong> Lead Pastor, National Community Church, Washington, DC; author, <em>Wild Goose Chase </em>and <em>Soulprint</em></p><p>&#x201c;Darrin slices through the clutter to give us insight on what is most important in launching a new work&#x2014;a clear understanding of a biblically functioning community led by one passionately committed to Jesus. This is a strong, excellent work that goes beyond pragmatic strategies and gives principles that will serve in any context. I'm fired up about a movement of leaders who will live out the core principles of <em>Church Planter</em> and launch churches that honor God and share his fame!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Jud Wilhite</strong>, author, <em>Eyes Wide Open</em>&nbsp;and <em>Uncensored Grace</em>; senior pastor, Central Christian Church, Las Vegas, Nevada</p><p>&#x201c;Darrin Patrick gets ministry. He understands it&#x2019;s not a career for those of us trying to do something for God. It&#x2019;s a calling that can only be fulfilled faithfully when built upon the foundation of scriptural norms. This is not only a great book for anyone involved in church planting&#x2014;it&#x2019;s also a great book for anyone involved in pastoral ministry. It will help you (and your team) keep your life, message, and mission aligned with God&#x2019;s vision and calling.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Larry Osborne</strong>, Pastor, North Coast Church, Vista, California; author, <em>Sticky Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;<em>Church Planter: the Man, the Message and the Mission</em> by Darrin Patrick is a must-read for anyone thinking about planting a church or who works with church planting leaders. While I don&#x2019;t hold to all of Darrin&#x2019;s theology of leadership I still highly recommend <em>Church Planter</em>. When it comes to church planting Darrin is a guy that absolutely &#x2018;gets it&#x2019; because he has done it! And you will &#x2018;get it&#x2019; too if you read this book!&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<strong>Dave Ferguson</strong><strong>,</strong> Lead Pastor, Community Christian Church, Naperville, Illinois; Lead Visionary, NewThing</p><p>&#x201c;If I were beginning the journey of starting a church, and I could only choose two books to take with me. They would be the Bible, and Church Planter by Darrin Patrick.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Matt Carter</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Pastor of Preaching, The Austin Stone Community Church, Austin, Texas; co-author,&nbsp;<em>The Real Win</em></p><p>&#x201c;There is no greater need in the world today than for men who will embody the unchanging message of the gospel in their own lives, and then carry it into the ever-changing communities in which we live. Darrin Patrick clearly articulates a compelling vision of the kind of leader and church we need in the twenty-first century. Every Christian man should read this book, and ask the question &#x2018;what part is God calling ME to play in planting transformational churches?&#x2019; Some may never have considered ministry, but reading this book could be dangerous for your career prospects. Other readers may be in paid church leadership, but will discover that God has been preparing a different, society-changing role for you to play. May God use this book to raise an army of church planting missionaries, some who will lead fantastic churches, others who will incarnate the gospel by being Christ-centered businessmen, caring professionals, or whatever it is that God has designed you to be. This book will convince you that there is hope for the church yet, and that the church is the only hope for this world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Adrian Warnock</strong>, author,&nbsp;<em>Hope Reborn</em>&nbsp;and <em>Raised with Christ</em></p><p>&#x201c;This book is a weapon. <em>Church Planter</em> is one of the more important pieces of equipment that a church planter (or a man aspiring to any level of church leadership) can own. Darrin Patrick writes out of biblical conviction and proven experience, not preference or pragmatics. I trust Darrin. I trust what he's written here. I hope this book is placed in the hands of men all over the world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Justin Buzzard</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Lead Pastor, Garden City Church, Silicon Valley; author, <em>Date Your Wife</em> and <em>The Big Story</em></p><p>&#x201c;Darrin does a great job describing the challenges of planting and directing the planter toward gospel solutions. Whether you&#x2019;re in the midst of planting or thinking about planting page 25 alone is worth the cost of the book.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<strong>Eric Simmons</strong>, Pastor, Redeemer Church of Arlington, Arlington, VA</p><p>&#x201c;In <em>Church Planter</em> Darrin Patrick gets to the heart of what it means to be a man who loves God and transforms communities. I like the fact that you don't have to agree with all of his theology to benefit from his wisdom. He shows us not just how to have great churches but how to have better cities. I think that reflects the heart of God. I know it captured mine.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<strong>Greg Surratt</strong>, Pastor, Seacoast Church</p><p>&#x201c;Darrin Patrick is one of the most important voices in the church plantingcommunity. Every potential church planter should read this book <em>before</em> he decides to plant, and every existing church planter should read this book once every year! Too many people care only about planting <em>more</em> churches. What we need is more healthy churches with healthy pastors.

The book is a How-To book that focuses on all aspects of the custom sheet metal fabrication industry. FULL-BORE SHEET METAL is an Infotaining book that is engaging and exciting to read packed with information and delivered in an entertaining way. It was written by shop guys for shop guys.</p><p>MARK PROSSER- grew up in a family-owned collision/restoration business. He has worked on automobiles in some capacity most of his adult life. There came a time when he gave up working on cars and began his educational excursion, which included several different degrees. After a ten year break from the auto industry, ironically, Mark s first teaching job was at Wyotech, the automotive school in Laramie, Wyoming. At Wyotech his love of the automobile was rekindled, but in a different way. This time the Kustom Bug bit and just wouldn t let go. Mark earned his Master s Degree in Adult Education in 2010; he is a certified welding inspector and educator through the American Welding Society. He is now a full time instructor at a Wisconsin technical college where he teaches welding and metal fabrication. Mark is also an author for Goodheart Wilcox Publishing, for whom he writes welding books. In his spare time he runs a small custom paint shop called Prosser Paint. BRYAN FULLER- Is the host of Two Guys Garage the oldest automotive-based show on television. What some people don t realize is that he is also a nationally renowned custom bike and car builder. He owns and operates Fuller Hot Rods out of Atlanta, Georgia. His creations have been highly decorated at most every major bike and car show in the country. Interestingly, Bryan did not grow up in the auto industry; it was only after college and time spent working a job he did not dig that he threw it all away, got some training, and moved to Southern California, where he worked with and learned from the best in the business, including So-Cal speed shop, GMT, and Foose Design. At the time, Bryan was one of Chip s members on the TLC show Overhaulin . Bryan packed up and moved to the ATL to start his own rocket ship, and that sucker hasn t slowed down yet. If you haven t heard of Fuller Hot Rods, you better get out of town a little more often."The authors took a different approach in this book, They make you feel as though you are there in the shop with them.

Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1908 to Russian immigrant parents, Dickson was a violinist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for nearly fifty years and Assistant Conductor for Arthur Fiedler's Boston Pops. He continues to conduct more than fifty concerts each year in the United States and abroad.<br>In this charming memoir, Dickson recollects his long and illustrious life and career. With humor and warmth, he shares reminiscences and anecdotes about his family and friends, colleagues, travels, and the Boston Symphony. An entertaining raconteur, Dickson relates his experiences, some amusing, some serious, in working with such renowned conductors and performers as Danny Kaye, Arthur Fiedler, Serge Koussevitzky, Seiji Ozawa, John Williams, and Igor Stravinsky. The memoir also includes Dickson's touching reflections on his wife, his daughters, and the failed presidential campaign of his son-in-law Michael Dukakis.</p><p>Although the author of this delightful memoir is now an octogenarian, his stories and writing style are as fresh as if he'd just begun his extraordinary career. As it is, he has a storehouse of tales about his 49 years as a violinist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) and as assistant conductor for the Boston Pops. Dickson (Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops, LJ 4/15/81) chronicles a fair amount of BSO history?the union movement, the introduction of young people's concerts, the road tours?without making this memoir sound like a dry textbook. Interspersed are many cameo appearances by world-famous figures, including conductors Serge Koussevitsky, Seiji Ozawa, and Arthur Fiedler and even Danny Kaye. His anecdotes are told with wit, charm, and impeccable timing. Dickson also tells of the trials of his Russian immigrant parents as well as the ups and downs of son-in-law Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign and its heartrending effects on his daughter, Kitty.

My feet are teetering on a wooden box, creating the illusion of height for the camera. To a viewer at home, the game board is as near as the screen. But here, it's a faraway wall, the opposite side of a river-blue stage.<br><br> Though glowing with color from remote-controlled spotlights, the room is remarkably quiet and still. The black plastic buzzer feels cold in my hand.<br><br> I can't see my opponents while we're playing the game, but I can feel their movements, the bodily cues of who's winning and losing: the small changes in posture, the shuffling of feet, the tensing of shoulders. With every response, our voices betray our excitement or calm, confusion or certainty, eagerness or dread. Choices of category and clue reveal personal strengths and confidence. Sometimes, I can even sense someone's breath being held very slightly when they realize--faster than me, far too often--that they know the next response.<br><br> As Alex reads a clue, I now sense such a breath being held on my left. A full second passes. And another. Our buzzers are powerless, disconnected until Alex has finished. Instants tick by. On my right, barely glimpsed, a thumb readies. But we wait.<br><br> I can't see Alex, either. I hear him, of course. His voice fills the room, reciting each clue with the perfect insistence of the timeline itself, a new clue every twelve seconds (on average) for more than twenty years. He is standing, as always, at his podium, just ten feet away, and almost in front of my eyes. But I cannot see Alex. In this moment, to my knowledge, he may not have physical form.<br><br> I am target-locked on the vast, distant game board: scanning the categories, thinking ahead, searching each clue for that one telling hint, considering dollar amounts and Daily Doubles and doing small silent bursts of math. And five times a minute, I am focusing on the last letter of the last word at the end of each clue, anticipating Alex's last syllable, preparing my signal, tweaking my rhythm, adjusting my perception of time.<br><br> Millions may watch. Friends, family, lovers, all those I've cared about, or ever will, might be silently present in spirit. If the TVs in Heaven have decent reception, even my dad may be watching right now. But while actually playing, I am deep in my head. Surrounded by cameras, I can see no one. In this moment, I'm completely alone.<br><br> Even Alex is simply a voice from within, a Freudian ego with perfect inflection, pushing your memory, probing your defenses, testing your tiniest grasp of reality. Move your eyes for an instant, break the trance for one moment, and the game will be finished too soon. As will you.<br><br> So every twelve seconds, every twelve seconds, every twelve seconds, finally: plastic cacophony, cliklikikkitylikkityclikit, fingers and thumbs, fingers and thumbs, frantically seeking correct milliseconds, white buttons crashing down hard on black buzzers, cliklikikkitylikkityclikit, an urgent loud triple attack.<br><br> I drive an old car named Max.<br><br> I am wearing shoes I bought for a funeral almost ten years ago.<br><br> I am competing in a tournament with a $2 million prize.<br><br> In the spaces between instants, entire futures float by.<br><br> This . . . is . . . JEOPARDY!<br><br> Eventually, mercifully: one player's light will come on.<br><br> It will very likely not be mine. Every contestant is always outnumbered.<br><br> To my right stands a five-time champion. He is taller and older and better educated than me. I have learned, in this very minute, that he knows words I've never heard. To my left stands a man who won an International Tournament of Champions. More than just a five-time champ, he was arguably once the best player on earth. He seems to know everything I've ever learned, at a minimum, and he's better on the buzzer than I am.<br><br> Surrounding the game board is a series of lights that will flash when it's time to respond. Since more than one player knows almost every response, precision of rhythm can sometimes trump brilliance. Winning and losing often turn not on memory, but on mastery of these electronic milliseconds.<br><br> I am not winning.<br><br> For almost an entire game, I have been choosing the wrong millisecond. And twelve seconds later, I have chosen the wrong millisecond again. So far, twenty-five clues into this Double Jeopardy round, I have won on the buzzer and then responded correctly exactly four times.<br><br> I am wondering, amid a hundred other racing thoughts, how I ever got here.<br><br> Whoever leads at the end of the Double Jeopardy round is usually the victor. But I am thousands of dollars behind. To have any real chance, I need to start winning quite suddenly, every twelve seconds. I will need to beat both of these players on the buzzer and answer correctly at least four more times.<br><br> One problem: there are only five clues remaining.<br><br> The next clue begins. As Alex's voice echoes softly inside my head, my eyes race through the words on the game board, hoping to gain perhaps one extra second. In a moment, I know the response. There is no sense of relief.<br><br> I take a breath, focus only on pacing and rhythm, and start sorting small fractions of time.<br><br> To my right, I feel a breath slightly held. To my left, a barely glimpsed thumb again readies.<br><br> A second passes. And then another. Alex approaches the end of the clue.<br><br> The right millisecond approaches.<br><br> I just have to find it.<br><br> If you're interested in what a player might try in that position, that's part of what this book is about.<br><br> If you're curious how anybody remembers the capital of Bhutan, great composers of Finland, or the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, that's another big chunk of what follows.<br><br> You might also wonder how winning and losing and studying so hard might affect a player's life, or if friendships evolve, or what Alex is like, or how having a bunch of new stuff in your head might feel. There's a lot of all that in here, too.<br><br> We will bounce between all these categories, sometimes quite suddenly. But just keep playing. We'll get the whole board cleared off by the end.<br><br> And if part of you doubts that you'd ever belong in a game like this, I understand.<br><br> That, in fact, is what everything else in the book is about.<br> 2<br><br> A COMPLETE INABILITY TO LEARN FROM FAILURE<br><br> Also, Incompetence, Ignorance, and Clumsiness<br> I don't remember what year it was the first time I failed the Jeopardy! test.<br><br> That might tell you a lot right there.<br><br> I also don't remember how many times I failed it. I'm pretty sure it was five, over the course of several years, beginning well over a decade ago. It might have only been four. Maybe six. I actually lost count.<br><br> I didn't go to Harvard or Berkeley or any school you'd probably recognize. I've read a good bit on my own about history and politics, but I have no advanced education in literature, the visual arts, or a hundred other subjects. For much of my life, the most sophisticated works I've been able to appreciate have been narrated by Morgan Freeman. I've never done anything distinguished enough to merit the sound of his voice.<br><br> I did once get a degree in electrical engineering, but Jeopardy! is about playing the giant game board, not giving it service under warranty. In a pinch, my college years might have been handy if you could rig your buzzer for "stun," replace the light pens with Tasers, or reboot Alex every time you start losing. Unfortunately, none of the wiring is all that accessible. Alex barely comes within reach.<br><br> I was never even much of an engineer. What formal training I did receive was made useless by time itself. The "advanced" computer language I studied as a sophomore was obsolete by the time I was a senior. Soon after my graduation, technology had accelerated so much that I might as well have studied Plowing With Oxen, Posing Naked On Ceremonial Pottery, or Things To Do With An Armored Codpiece.

The Nazi swastika represented crossed S-letters for &#34;socialism&#34; under the Nazis (the National Socialist German Workers Party). The Pledge was written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy. Francis was cousin to Edward Bellamy, author of an international bestseller in 1888 that launched the nationalism movement. Edward&#39;s book was translated into every major language, including German. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed socialists in the Nationalism movement and they promoted military socialism. The Bellamys wanted government to take over all schools. When the government granted their wish, the government&#39;s schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy. Government schools also forced robotic chanting to flags. All of that behavior even outlasted German National Socialism (or Nazism, although German National Socialists did not call themselves Nazis, they called themselves Socialists and National Socialists). In addition to the notorious salute, American socialists also bear some blame for the notorious symbol used by the National Socialist German Workers Party on its flag. Edward Bellamy worked with the Theosophical Society, another socialist group, and during that time the Theosophical Society used the symbol adopted later by German National Socialists. It is commonly called a swastika, although German socialists called it a Hakenkreuz (hooked cross). Although an ancient symbol, the swastika was altered for use as overlapping S-letters for &#39;socialism.&#39; It was turned 45 degrees from the horizontal and was oriented in the S-direction to highlight the overlapping S-letters for &#34;socialism.&#34; Similar alphabetic symbolism was used in the SS division and similar symbolism is still visible today, every day, on the streets as Volkswagen logos. As part of the anti libertarian practice, people were persecuted for refusing to perform the straight-arm salute and mechanical chanting to the national flag. That happened at the same time in the USA and in Germany. The Pledge&#39;s early right-arm salute was not an ancient Roman salute. The ancient Roman salute is a myth. Professor Curry showed that the &#39;ancient Roman salute&#39; myth came from the Pledge. Take the Pledge not to Pledge. Stop kissing the government&#39;s butt every morning. Remove the pledge from the flag. Remove flags from schools. Remove schools from government.

The book takes readers into the savage action at infamous places like Tam Ky, the Que Son Valley, the Pineapple Forest, Hill 34, and Cigar Island, chronicling General Westmoreland&#x2019;s search-and-destroy war of attrition against the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army. Exploring the gray areas of guerrilla war, military historian Keith Nolan details moments of great compassion toward the Vietnamese, but also eruptions of My Lai-like violence, the grimmer aspects of the 1/1&#x2019;s successes. <i>Search&nbsp;and Destroy</i> is a rare account of an exemplary fighting force in action, a dramatic close-up look at the Vietnam War.</p></p><p><p><b>Keith W. Nolan</b> studied the Vietnam War for twenty-five years and has published articles on the subject in <i>Leatherneck, the Marine Corps Gazette, Proceedings</i>, and <i>Vietnam </i><i>magazine</i>. He is also the author of eleven Vietnam War combat histories, all of which have been Military Book Club selections.&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Military Review</i></b></p><p>[<i>Search and Destroy</i>] is a terrific book that tells the story of the 1-1st Cavalry Squadron...Like all of Nolan's books, this one tells its story from the first-hand accounts of the soldiers and junior officers who fought the war on the ground and from the extensive research of official Army records. Through interviews with dozens of 1-1st Cav veterans, Nolan tells it like it is, warts and all. There are accounts of breathtaking heroism, of leadership that ranges from superb and courageous to badly flawed, and disturbing accounts of atrocities and mindless violence against Vietnamese civilians...Vietnam veterans will enjoy this honest account of a cavalry squadron's experience during a difficult and challenging year of unrelenting combat.</p></p><h2>Reminisce Holiday Memories</h2><p>Reminisce Holiday Memories Rekindle the Joys of Christmas Past</p><p></p><h2>Mission Compromised</h2><p><p><strong> The New York Times bestselling novel from controversial military legend Oliver North.</strong></p><p> Major Peter Newman, US Marines, was a highly decorated hero, content doing his job &#x2013; leading his troops into harm's way. He was good at it. But the White House has other plans for him.</p><p> When Newman is handpicked for a dangerous clandestine operation as the head of the White House Special Projects Office, his orders are clear &#x2013; hunt down and eliminate terrorists before they attack the United States with weapons of mass destruction.</p><p> From the corridors of power in Washington to the heart of the Middle East, Newman finds himself on an assignment so sensitive that it's known only to a handful of officials, as he becomes entangled in a nightmarish web of intrigue, revenge and betrayal. </p><p> When the mission is compromised, Newman embarks on a personal odyssey that threatens his career, his life and his loyalty to Corps and country. </p><p> </p></p><p><p>Oliver North is a combat-decorated Marine, a syndicated columnist, the host of a nationally syndicated daily radio talk show on the Radio America Network, and the host of "War Stories" on the <em>FOX</em> News Channel.</p><p>North was born in San Antonio, Texas, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and served twenty-two years as a U.S. Marine. His awards for service in combat include the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for valor, and two Purple Hearts for wounds in action. Assigned to the National Security Council Staff in the Reagan administration, Lt. Col. North was the U.S. government's Counter-Terrorism Coordinator from 1983 to 1986. He was involved in planning the rescue of medical students on the island of Grenada, and played a major role in the daring capture of the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille Lauro. After helping plan the U.S. raid on Muammar Gaddafi's terrorist bases in Libya, North was targeted for assassination by Abu Nidal, one of the world's deadliest assassins.</p><p>North's first two books, <em>Under Fire </em>and <em>One More Mission,</em> were international bestsellers. North is the founder of Freedom Alliance, a foundation which provides scholarships for the sons and daughters of service members killed in action.</p>It's hard to figure out just what North has in mind here: a little payback, perhaps, for some of the controversial ex-Marine's treatment by the Beltway establishment? A Christian tract disguised as a topical thriller? An attempt to use every single governmental abbreviation-from AmCits (American citizens) to WHDB (White House Data Base)-in one book? This giant novel (the first in a projected series of three) fits every one of those criteria, and also has a plot so convoluted that a snake might get motion sickness and characters so thin they make Tom Clancy look like Jane Austen. After flashbacks to three sets of killings in 1986, the narrative skips to 1994, when a career Marine Corps officer, Maj. Peter Newman, arrives at the Clinton White House to head a special projects office that hasn't been manned since another Marine-Oliver North-was booted out in 1987. "Look, if you think I'm going to accept a job only to go down in flames like he did, you'd better think again. I'll resign my commission first," Newman growls. But the major, who lost a younger brother in the military disaster at Mogadishu recounted in Black Hawk Down, takes the job when he realizes it will let him go after the warlords (including a rich Saudi called Osama bin Laden) responsible for that debacle. In a preface dated December 14, 2001, Fox News reporter North writes from aboard a U.S. warship with troops bound for Afghanistan, thanking coauthor Musser for his "gift for words" that "has made my military phraseology comprehensible to civilians." Perhaps those thanks were premature.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>FIRM FOUND.CREATION TO CHRIST-STUDY GDE by Trevor McIlwain (2009-05-03)</h2><p>Firm Foundations: Creation to Christ Adult Chronological Bible Study Student Notebook The study guide for the Firm Foundations: Creation to Christ curriculum.

To map some of the winding, untraveled roads that connect today's music to its ancestors, Russell draws upon new research and rare source material, such as contemporary newspaper reports and magazine articles, internet genealogy sites, and his own interviews with the musicians or their families. The result is a lively mix of colorful tales and anecdotes, priceless contemporary accounts of performances, illuminating social and historical context, and well-grounded critical judgment. The essays are enhanced by more than 200 illustrations, many of them seldom seen and some never before published, including artist photographs, record labels, song sheets, newspaper clippings, cartoons, advertisements, and magazine covers, recreating the look and feel of the entire culture of country music. Each essay includes as well a playlist of recommended and currently available recordings for each artist.<br> <em>Country Music Originals</em> is a collection of gems which will delight the aficionado and first-time enthusiast as well as the scholar of American folk music.</p><p><br><strong>Tony Russell</strong> is a music historian who has written on country music, blues, jazz, and other forms of popular music in a wide variety of publications and has researched, written, and presented many musical programs for BBC Radio.

He lives in London.<br>"Country Music Originals combines Tony Russell's encyclopedic knowledge of country music with a lively and matchless prose style. Russell brings to life the work of both major artists and obscure figures whose important contributions might well have been lost were it not for his voluminous<br>research and penetrating insights. It's a stunning achievement, perhaps the best book yet written on the subject."--Nolan Porterfield, author of Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler<br><br>"Few people alive know as much about the early history of country music as Tony Russell does. Even fewer can write as engagingly about it. In these concise portraits of country music's pioneers, he brings America's musical past to life, revealing such dimly remembered figures as Uncle Jimmy<br>Thompson and Charlie Poole as the living, breathing, creative, and complicated characters they once were. Thoroughly entertaining and indispensable for fans of early country and roots music."--Paul Kingsbury, editor of Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Country Music in America and The Encyclopedia of<br>Country Music<br><br>"Tony Russell is today's pre-eminent country music historian. His exhaustive research and congenially articulate writings have bequeathed much of what we know about the music and those who made it.

You are not alone. In a society that is very disconnected from the natural world, many individuals find themselves wondering about what lies beyond the pavement. We know that our ancestors lived by their bare hands and wits alone, but how did they do it? How would you do it? What would it be like to be so connected with the natural world that you could just leave everything behind and walk away into the woods? It is easier than you might expect. <p>You might think you would need to take a lot of classes and learn a gazillion skills to survive, but the real secret is in knowing how not to need very many skills at all. For example, if you've made a bowdrill fire set with a steel knife, you may wonder how to make a set without a knife. So how do you make a good enough stone knife to work wood as nicely as your steel knife? You don't. By breaking sticks and abrading them on rocks you can make a completely serviceable bowdrill set without the need for a fancy knife at all. In Participating in Nature and the Art of Nothing Wilderness Survival Video Series, as well as in our classes at Hollowtop Outdoor Primitive School, LLC, you can learn the skills to reconnect with the natural world in a truly unique way, becoming as comfortable in the woods as you are in your own home.</p></p><h2>A Summer on the Plains with Custer&#39;s 7th Cavalry: The 1870 Diary of Annie Gibson Roberts</h2><p>Annie Roberts Yates was 27 years old when her soldier husband perished with his commander, George Armstrong Custer, at the battle of Little Bighorn. We catch occasional glimpses of Annie in Libbie Custer s memoirs, or in newspaper accounts of the sorrowful aftermath of Custer s Last Stand a young widow dressed in mourning, her dark hair turned gray with grief. She remains as elusive as she is fascinating. Talented musician and vocalist, skilled rider and sharpshooter, accomplished linguist and devoted Shakespearean, self-critical and idealistic, practical and romantic Annie Yates was a most unusual woman. Annie Gibson Roberts was born in Philadelphia on April 27, 1849, the daughter of William Milnor Roberts, one of America s most accomplished civil engineers. Following her mother s death, from 1859 to 1865 Annie and her five brothers lived in the jungles of Brazil, where her father supervised the construction of the first railroad into the interior of that country. By 1870 Annie was staying in St. Louis, where Milnor Roberts was employed as chief engineer, building the great Eads Bridge that spanned the Mississippi. From girlhood Annie had recorded her daily experiences in little pocket diaries. On January 1, 1870, after admonishing herself to <i>Take care of the hours &amp; the days will take care of themselves,</i> 20-year-old Annie exuberantly greeted the new year with, <i>How d ye do 1870 Well you are a lusty old fellow! We will be firm friends if you only treat me half as well as your predecessor.</i> Little did she imagine how fateful that year was destined to be. Though she was never considered a great beauty, Annie's large blue eyes and mass of dark brown, nearly black hair, her poise and her invariably fashionable attire, combined to make her a striking figure. Her wit, her sense of fun and her artistic talents made her a welcome addition to St. Louis society. Among Annie Roberts friends was Major General Wesley Merritt, one of the Union s ablest cavalry commanders in the Civil War, and she dutifully chronicled several marriage proposals from young army officers. In those first months of 1870 there was one for whom Annie came to hold special feelings: Paul Dahlgren, a Second Lieutenant in the 3rd Artillery. She found the 23-year-old son of Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren as bright as a new shilling, and their friendship soon blossomed into romance, though it was a tempestuous one. It was at this point that Annie Roberts left St. Louis to spend a summer on the plains at Fort Hays, Kansas accepting the hospitality of her uncle, Major George Gibson, the Post Commander. There she would meet for the first time George Armstrong Custer and the officers of the 7th U. S. Cavalry one of whom was destined to become her husband. A Summer on the Plains chronicles Annie s experiences on the western frontier, with perceptive observations of the 7th U. S. Cavalry and the Custer inner-circle. Her participation in a Great Buffalo Hunt is recounted in dramatic and exciting fashion. At Fort Hays Annie fell in love with Captain George Yates Custer s friend from Civil War days and the steadfast commander of Company F, the Band Box Troop. They married despite the objections of her family, and raised three children on the isolated and dangerous frontier. The book has two diary sections, a chapter on George Yates, a chapter on the Buffalo Hunt, as well as six appendices. They include Libbie Custer s memories of the great buffalo hunt, Annie s horse riding list, Annie s perceptions of General Custer and a profile she wrote on him, George Yates letters from the 1874 Black Hills Expedition, and a remembrance of Mrs. Custer by a daughter-in-law of the Seventh Cavalry.</p><p></p><h2>Uncoiling the Snake: Ancient Patterns in Contemporary Women&#39;s Lives (A Snakepower Reader)</h2><p>This multicultural collection of essays, stories, pictures and poems celebrate women&#39;s power to heal.

She lives in New York City.Kindergarten-Grade 3. Isadora's winsome ballerina has returned?this time backstage. Lili arrives at the theater prior to a performance of Sleeping Beauty, and while searching for her grandfather, a French-horn player in the orchestra, she explores the rehearsal area; stage loft; costume, wig, prop, and make-up rooms; canteen; and even under the stage, finally finding Grandpa Max waiting for her in the orchestra pit. As with Lili at Ballet (1993) and Lili on Stage (1995, both Putnam), Isadora's latest work treats youngsters to the sights and sounds of a dancer's world. Her explanations are simple and clear, conveying not only information but also a sense of excitement about the theatrical realm. The double-page, realistic watercolors are a perfect complement to the text. Their colors are bright and varied, their detail meticulous. They convey a tremendous sense of movement and feature a variety of ethnic groups. A welcome addition to picture-book collections, not only for ballerina wannabes, but also for those who are intrigued by the romance of getting "behind the scenes."?Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American History Fifth Edition</h2><p>Student Textbook based on our nation&#39;s history</p><p></p><h2>Entre les Murs (Collection Folio (Gallimard)) (French Edition)</h2><p>The book that inspired the film, The Class, which went on to win the Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes 2008.</p><p>Francois Begaudeau est l auteur de Entre les murs (ed.

It had fewer stations than NBC or CBS, few advertisers, and therefore little revenue with which to pay for new programming. In order just to stay on the air, the &#x201c;other network&#x201d; was forced to schedule dozens of low-budget quiz shows, interview programs, and documentary films (most obtained free from government and industry). Needless to say, this did not attract much of an audience to the network. In 1952 ABC tried an experiment. It assembled a package of several dozen low-budget 30-minute dramatic films, most of them made by MCA Films in Hollywood. Many of them had been seen on TV before, on ABC (Gruen Guild Theater), DuMont (Gruen Playhouse), and some even on NBC (Campbell Soundstage). These shopworn films were sprinkled liberally throughout the ABC schedule during the 1952&#x2013;1953 season, on multiple &#x201c;theater&#x201d; series. Each film ran up to half a dozen times on different nights and on different series. Not every film would turn up on every series, but if you watched ABC long enough you would frequently get the impression that you had &#x201c;seen that film before.&#x201d;<br><br>Most of the films were grade &#x201c;B&#x201d; productions, starring some Hollywood old-timers as well as lesser-known young actors and actresses (some of whom were to gain fame in later years). Among them were Buddy Ebsen, Raymond Burr, Cesar Romero, Ann Rutherford, Helen Parrish, Vincent Price, Anita Louise, Hans Conried, Cliff Arquette, Onslow Stevens, and many others. The scripts included mysteries (such as &#x201c;The Cavorting Statue&#x201d; with Cesar Romero), romantic tales (&#x201c;A Little Pig Cried&#x201d; with Frances Rafferty), and comedies.<br><br>Following is a list of the theater series among which the films rotated, mostly during 1952&#x2013;1953.

It was launched in 1977 as CBN, the Christian Broadcasting Network, and originally featured a heavy dose of religious programming. A vestige of that era remains on its schedule today in The 700 Club (q.v.), a Christian news and features magazine hosted by network founder Pat Robertson. Among CBN&#x2019;s drama series during the 1980s were Another Life (1981&#x2013;1984), a Christian soap opera; and The Campbells (1986&#x2013;1989), about a Scottish family in the Canadian wilderness in the 1830s. CBN&#x2019;s big production center in Virginia Beach, Virginia, said to be the largest facility in the world for the production of Christian TV programming, was dubbed the &#x201c;Video Vatican.&#x201d;<br><br>The network gradually broadened its focus, acquiring a wide range of broadcast reruns, especially westerns but also including cartoons, game shows, and dramas (The Waltons, Rescue 911). In 1989, CBN was renamed the Family Channel. Although it promoted itself as the home of &#x201c;positive-value, upbeat programming the whole family can enjoy,&#x201d; its schedule was hardly without violence, particularly in rerun westerns such as Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and The Young Riders. However, it generally avoided the contemporary sex and violence that is so widespread on broadcast channels. Family also became one of the more prolific producers of original series programming on cable, most of it light action/adventure emphasizing relationships and individual courage. There were also some sitcoms. Among its earlier series were Bordertown, Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop, and Zorro; later entries included Big Brother Jake, Maniac Mansion, Snowy River: The MacGregor Saga, Madeline, and That&#x2019;s My Dog.<br><br>In 1998, Pat Robertson sold the network to Rupert Murdoch&#x2019;s News Corporation, which operates the Fox Network and is known for precisely the kind of edgy (often sexy and violent) programming the Family Channel traditionally abhorred. Effective August 15, 1998, the name was changed to the Fox Family Channel, and there were major on-air changes&#x2014;though not, initially at least, toward the kind of raunchy programming critics feared. Daytime was given over to cartoons and other kids&#x2019; programming, while in the evening there were lightweight family shows including I Can&#x2019;t Believe You Said That (quiz), Show Me the Funny (videos), Life, Camera, Action! (more videos), Ohhh, Noooo! Mr. Bill Presents (English comedy sketches), and The New Addams Family (sitcom). There were also nightly movies, including some produced by the channel.<br><br>Later entries included Higher Ground, The Fearing Mind and the critically acclaimed State of Grace. None of these was terribly successful, and after only three years Fox sold the network to Disney/ABC, which in November 2001 renamed it the ABC Family Channel. It then began to air reruns of current ABC series such as Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Alias, According to Jim, Life with Bonnie, Less Than Perfect, Celebrity Mole and The Bachelor. It also produced some reality programs of its own, including The Last Resort (specials, 2002) and My Life Is a Sitcom (series, 2003).<br><br>The network first reached more than half of all U.S. television homes in June 1989, and its principal original evening series after that date (including those mentioned above) can be found in this book under their individual titles.<br><br>ABC FEATURE FILM, see Movies&#x2014;Prior to 1961<br><br>ABC IN CONCERT (Music)<br><br>FIRST TELECAST: June 7, 1991<br><br>LAST TELECAST: September 11, 1998<br><br>BROADCAST HISTORY:<br><br>Jun 1991&#x2013;Dec 1992, ABC Fri 12:00 midnight&#x2013; 1:00 a.m.<br><br>Jan 1993&#x2013;Jan 1997, ABC Fri 12:05&#x2013;12:35 a.m.<br><br>Jan 1997&#x2013;Sep 1998, ABC Fri 12:35&#x2013;1:05 a.m.<br><br>HOST:<br><br>Madison Michele (1996&#x2013;1998)<br><br>From 1973 to 1975, as part of its Wide World o...</p><h2>The Complete Guide to Horses</h2><p>What&#39;s the difference between a horse and a pony?

Mark Twain) has a dream: to build a riverboat that will rival the most magnificent paddle-wheelers ever navigated on the mighty Mississippi. Then, to steer it up the endless waterway that dominates his new home planet--and at last discover its hidden source.<br><br>But before he can carry out his plan, he first must undertake a dangerous voyage to unearth a fallen meteor. This mission would require striking an uneasy alliance with the bloodthirsty Viking Erik Bloodaxe, treacherous King John of England, legendary French swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac, Greek adventurer Odysseus, and the infamous Nazi Hermann G�ring. All for the purpose of storming the ominous stone tower at the mouth of the river, where the all-powerful overseers of Riverworld--and their secrets--lie in wait . . .</p><p>In <i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i>, Philip Jos� Farmer introduces readers to the awesome Riverworld, a planet that had been carved into one large river on whose shores all of humanity throughout the ages has seemingly been resurrected. In <i>The Fabulous Riverboat</i>, Farmer tells the tale of one person whose is uniquely suited to find the river's headwaters, riverboat captain and famous Earthly author Sam Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain). Clemens has been visited by "X," a mysterious being who claims to be a rebel among the group that created Riverworld. X tells Clemens where he can find a large deposit of iron and other materials that Clemens can use to build the greatest riverboat ever seen. Since there is virtually no metal on the planet, it will also give Clemens an unbeatable edge when it comes to battling the various warlike societies that dominate the Riverworld.<p> But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld. However, Clemens has a guardian angel in the form of Joe Miller, a giant subhuman with a big nose, a serious lisp, and a cutting wit. Miller has also been to the very headwaters of the river, where he saw a mysterious tower in the middle of the North Sea and where the creators of Riverworld are thought to reside. He will be an invaluable ally in completing the riverboat and sailing to the headwaters, but even an 800-pound giant may not be enough to help Clemens fulfill X's mission. <i>--Craig E.

But her quest is jeopardized by Nicholas Harpole, who stirs unfamiliar emotions within her about her future-with a man she will long outlive. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re reading something by Kage Baker, fasten your seat belt-you&#x2019;re in for a wild ride&#x201d; (Gardner Dozois).<br></p><p>In 16th-century Spain, everybody expects the Spanish Inquisition, as they have a well-known tendency to cart people off to their dungeons on trumped-up charges. What 5-year-old Mendoza, on the brink of being tortured as a Jew, is totally unprepared for is to be rescued by the Company--the ultimate bureaucracy of the 24th century--and made immortal. In return, all she has to do is travel through time on a series of assignments for the Company and collect endangered botanical specimens. The wisecracking, mildly misanthropic Mendoza wants nothing to do with historical humans, but her first assignment is to travel to England in 1553--uncomfortably close to those damn Inquisitors--with Joseph and Nefer, two other Company operatives. Their intent is to gather herb samples from the garden of Sir Walter Iden, a foolish though generous country squire. (Kage Baker knows her Shakespeare: Sir Walter is the descendant of Alexander Iden, loyal subject of Henry IV, who slew the hungry rebel Jack Cade in that very garden in Kent.) <p> The cyborg trio poses as Doctor Ruy Lopez, his daughter Rosa (the irrepressible Mendoza, now grown), and her duenna, Do�a Marguerita; Sir Walter's hospitality and discretion are bought for the promise of restored youth. (There are hilarious moments that call to mind the Coneheads, who claimed to be from France when caught doing anything peculiar.) Sir Walter's secretary, Nicholas Harpole, is immediately suspicious of and hostile towards the strange "Spanish" visitors, which prompts Mendoza to fall in love with him. Nicholas has his own badly kept secret: he's proudly Protestant at a time when Queen Mary and Philip of Spain are on a Catholicizing rampage. Mendoza knows Nicholas is probably doomed, and that as a Company operative she cannot meddle with his fate, but love makes people do desperate things. Baker surpasses even Connie Willis in humor and precision of period detail in this fresh, ingenious first novel.<i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Born in Hollywood, Kage Baker has been an artist, actor, and director at the Living History Centre, and has taught Elizabethan English as a Second Language.

Some, such as Tuthmosis III, had a major impact on their time, and were remembered by their own people until the very civilization collapsed. Others, such as Tutankhamun, were soon forgotten by the Egyptians themselves, only to burst into popular culture thousands of years after their deaths, as a result of the labors of modern archeologists. Still more remain unknown outside the small circle of professional archeologists, but led lives that call out for wider dissemination. This book sets out to provide a mix of all three categories, in an attempt to present a balanced view of Egyptian kings and their range of achievements.</p><p>AIDAN DODSON is a senior research fellow in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol, where he teaches Egyptology. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 2003. He is the author of Monarchs of the Nile (AUC Press, 2000) and Amarna Sunset (AUC Press, 2009).This especially readable volume packs great detail into eighteen chapters (which generally deal with their subjects thematically: i.e., "Openers of the Ways", "Seizers of the Two Lands", "Kings of the Sun", "Feud of the Ramessides", "Of Kings and Priests", etc.). There is also a useful Chronology (with kings' nomens and prenomens) and a unique list of the Royal Cemeteries (who was buried where), as well as several maps, at the end of the volume. Additionally, the author provides genealogies in the text, where these help clarify confusing lines of descent -- <i>KMT, Spring 1996</i></p><h2>A Nantucket Christmas</h2><p>People from all over the United States come to Nantucket Island to celebrate Christmas in the charming Early American setting. Every year, during the week after Thanksgiving, a select number of houses--most more than 200 years old--are chosen to be on a house-tour for visiting tourists and islanders. Leslie Linsley, renowned style and craft expert, and author of the recently published Leslie Linsleys Decoupage, is also a resident of Nantucket. In A NANTUCKET CHRISTMAS she offers ideas for Christmas trees, door decorations, mantels, and much more, all inspired by the homes of Nantucket. Also included are projects such as ornaments and stockings as well as festive recipes and inspirations for table settings and entertaining.</p><p>Leslie Linsley is the author of Nantucket Style, and has written more than 50 books on crafts, decorating, and home style, including the recently published Leslie Linsley's Decoupage. She resides in Nantucket and has a store on the Island that specializes in her one-of-a-kind creations.<br>Nantucket, the charming little island off the coast of Massachusetts that&#x2019;s reachable only by boat or plane, is primarily seen as a summer vacation spot, but this festive gift book shows that the New England town can be just as appealing when blanketed by snow as it is in the heat of summer. Linsley (Leslie Linsley&#x2019;s D�coupage, etc.) takes readers on a tour of the island&#x2019;s exquisite 200-year-old homes at their most splendid: Christmastime. Packed with full-color photographs of the homes of the author&#x2019;s friends and acquaintances, the book includes many New England touches, including snapshots of boats and ships, simple shingle residences, shop windows lit up for the season and lighthouses. The author provides adequate historical background information on the buildings, as well as tips for anyone interested in arts and crafts; projects include making a fan plaque out of greenery and citrus fruit and arranging flowers for an elegant centerpiece. Linsley also includes a recipe for a stunning Pear Almond Tart, making this more than just an attractive coffee-table book. The volume can seem repetitive, as many of the homes are decorated by the same designers and floral arrangers, resulting in an endless array of sophisticated white lights, cranberries in glass containers and red candles on the mantel. In addition, people don&#x2019;t figure in any of the photographs, which is a shame; having a few festive faces, perhaps at the many parties and events Linsley mentions, would help display the holiday spirit the author is trying to convey. Still, readers who like this style of decoration will find inspiration in this book, even if it doesn&#x2019;t persuade them to weather a winter in Nantucket.

Rosen argues that Schoenberg&#39;s music, with its atonality and dissonance, possesses a rare balance of form and emotion, making it the most expressive music ever written. Concise and accessible, this book looks at Schoenberg&#39;s ambiguous relation both to the central tradition of Western music and to the complex developments of modernism. Rosen analyzes Schoenberg&#39;s expressionist beginnings and how they relate in theory, performance, and musical experience to the system of atonality set forth in the music of Berg, Webern, and Schoenberg himself.Charles Rosen is professor in the Committee on Social Thought and the Department of Music at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>Fried Chicken: An American Story</h2><p>A noted food writer celebrates one of America&#39;s quintessential contributions to world cuisine, tracing the history of fried chicken in all its manifestations across the country, from the Deep South, to a Jersey Shore hotel, to a Kansas City roadhouse, offering fifteen superlative recipes along the way. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>John T.

Fisher Distinguished Writing Award from the James Beard Foundation.Why did the chicken cross the continent? To get to the buttermilk-bathed, Creole-fried, mojo-marinated recipes, of course. Edge (<i>A Gracious Plenty</i>) directs Ole Miss's Southern Foodways Alliance, which studies the South's diverse food cultures, and he dishes up a combo plate of cookbook/travelogue, describing stopovers on his poultry pilgrimage across America, tasting and testing. His quest took him from New Orleans to Nashville (the "fiery goodness" of Prince's Hot Chicken Shack) and from L.A. to Buffalo (home of Buffalo wings). He focuses on individual cooks and family-run enterprises, so KFC and other chains get scant space. Instead, chapters close with regional recipes (e.g., Cape May's Onion-Fried Shore Chicken). Fryer facts flow like gravy, along with pop culture references, and there's an outstanding chapter recounting how celebrated Creole-Soul cook Austin Leslie inspired the Emmy-winning CBS series <i>Frank's Place</i> (1987). Edge concludes that the top dishes are found "where the cooks monkey the most with the birds." Throughout, he shares evocative descriptions of people and places, and designer Stephanie Huntwork's attractive gingham graphics and place-mat pages add a down-home feel. This clever, witty little book offers a heaping helping of chicken facts, and the appendix listing 34 "favorite chicken houses" in 14 states is a fitting finale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But sciences such as geology, astronomy, and anthropology also don't rely on laboratory testing for repeatable results. Moreover, psi concerns consciousness, which is by definition nonquantitative. "Psi researchers must stop acting like science's poor relations," says author Lawrence LaShan, "limiting themselves to controlled experiments such as analyzing statistics of people guessing cards being flipped in the next room"</p><p>This provocative book outlines the principles of making a real study of the large, exciting events -- clairvoyance and precognition; mediumship and spirit controls; psychic healing -- that would bring mainline science into and revitalize the whole field. "And the issue is not just academic," says LeShan. "The old, materialistic worldview has not worked. Psychic research," he argues, "can transform our sense of reality itself to offer a new and more hopeful picture of ourselves and of the world."<br></p></p><p><b>Lawrence LeShan, Ph.D.</b> is a research and clinical psychologist who has worked with cancer patients for over forty years.

Yes, there is, and Lawrence LeShan has said it beautifully. Some of his readers might not agree with his assessment of paranormal experiences. But I doubt that they will ever think about reality and rationality in quite the same way again. <i>A New Science of the Paranormal</i> is LeShan's distillation of decades of research and contemplation; it reveals a brilliant mind at the peak of its intellectual prowess.<br>" --<b>Stanley Krippner, PhD</b>, Professor of Psychology, Saybrook Graduate School, co-editor, <i>Varieties of Anomalous Experience: Assessing the Scientific Evidence</i><br><br>"Drawing on a lifetime's research into the further reaches of consciousness, Lawrence LeShan brilliantly draws the outlines of a wider science and a deeper worldview.

The editors of <i>Cook's Illustrated</i> magazine have settled the issue. It's all right here in <i>Steaks, Chops, Roasts, and Ribs</i>: Where the tenderloin can be found on the beef, whether to buy it untrimmed or not, how to roll and tie it for uniform roasting (including a sidebar on how to tie the butcher's knot), the best temperature at which to roast this cut of meat, and the length of time you can expect to wait beside the oven door. Having tested the process with 11 tenderloin roasts, these editors tell you all you need to know to get the results you want. <p> <i>Steaks, Chops, Roasts, and Ribs</i> opens with meat basics. If you know where a specific cut of meat comes from, you have a leg up on how best to cook the meat. Pork, lamb, veal, and beef are all covered. The buying information leads to a section on cooking basics. And then into the chapters. This isn't a book based so much on the kind of meat as on what you want to accomplish with any meat. The chapters cover steak (cooking outside and indoors), chops, cutlets, ground meat, ham, roasts, and more--polus there's a chapter on Rubs, Sauces, Salsa, and Gravy.</p><p> The pace is moderate and the information is thorough, both about the product, the technique, and the truth by experience about the tools you need to achieve success. There are hundreds of helpful line drawings and pages of color photos. And most important of all, 300 recipes that have been tested and retested by the people who invented the test kitchen. <i>Steaks, Chops, Roasts, and Ribs</i> is the meat eaters insurance policy. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Forget the spinach, forget the potatoes: many Americans dream of a dinner with a glistening, juicy, well-caramelized steak. But with high-end steaks pushing $20 a pound, there&#x2019;s little room to experiment, which makes this collection of fail-proof recipes by the editors of Cook&#x2019;s Illustrated (The Best Recipe; etc.) all the more valuable. Reading the volume is like taking a crash-course at the butcher&#x2019;s: the first 20 pages explain and rate various different cuts of beef, veal, pork and lamb, as well as various cooking methods (grill-roasting, pan-searing, braising, etc.). Subsequent chapters are organized to satisfy all kinds of kitchen hankerings (e.g. "I Want to Cook Meat on a Stick," "I Want to Make Pot Roast") using simple and easy techniques. Ever concerned with efficiency and affordability, the C.I./America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen team devised many innovations for this collection, among them a tasty Beef Goulash that doesn&#x2019;t require beef stock and a method for slicing beef for Philly Cheesesteak Sandwiches with a food processor. Attractive line drawings illustrate important techniques like making a pan sauce and working with supermarket puff pastry. From simple recipes like Pan-Fried Breaded Pork Cutlets (complemented by an excellent recipe for homemade Japanese Tonkatsu sauce) to more time-consuming ones like the flavor-bursting Braised Lamb Shanks with Lemon and Mint, the recipes streamline traditional dishes without loosing an ounce of flavor. Perhaps in response to complaints that Cook&#x2019;s Illustrated recipes can be boring, this cookbook includes several contemporary sauce ideas-such as Roasted Red Pepper and Smoked Paprika Butter for steaks and assertive wet-rubs for pork tenderloin-that would not be out-of-place in a professional kitchen. This cookbook could quickly become indispensable to any carnivore&#x2019;s dinner dreams.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Smiths and ploughmen; spirits of forest, stream, and home; the upper and lower worlds and the cult of death; serpents, dragons, and monsters; witches and wizards; shape-changing; wondrous animals; and giants and midgets are among the subjects covered. Familiar figures like Baba Yaga and Vasilisa receive their due. The appendix includes sections on symbolism and the Russian alphabet. Koshkin's exquisite paintings and his intelligent, witty line drawings make this a memorable book. Unfortunately, the arrangement of text on the page makes for a monotonous, uninviting appearance. Double vertical columns with scant margins detract from a thing of beauty. Although there is little comparable material available and young readers will be attracted by the monsters, YAs and adults who are serious students of mythology and art are the most appropriate audiences for this title.<br><i>Libby K. White, Schenectady County Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 7^-12. Folklorist Warner draws on original Russian sources, retelling the stories with direct drama and weaving them together with general discussion about their folklore motifs and history. The famous witch Baba Yaga is here, so is the evil Koshchei the Deathless; and there are chapters on giants and midgets, serpents and dragons, smiths and ploughmen. There are nature myths and Russian wonder tales of worlds above and worlds below. The individual stories are great for sharing, and the collection is an excellent resource for cross-curricular studies of Russian history and culture. Alexander Koshkin's sweeping, detailed illustrations, in black-and-white and in glowing color, show the romance and the terror, the demons and the heroes, of the shape-changing landscape. Part of the World Mythology series, this large-size, lavishly illustrated collection was first published in England in 1985. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine Is Making Us Sicker and Poorer</h2><p><p>Though touted as perhaps the best in the world, the American medical system is filled with hypocrisies. Our health care is staggeringly expensive, yet one in six Americans has no health insurance. We have some of the most skilled physicians in the world, yet one hundred thousand patients die each year from medical errors. In this gripping, eye-opening book, award-winning journalist Shannon Brownlee takes readers inside the hospital to dismantle some of our most venerated myths about American medicine. Using vivid examples of real patients and physicians, <i>Overtreated</i> debunks the idea that most of medicine is based in sound science, and shows how our health care system delivers huge amounts of unnecessary care that is not only expensive and wasteful but can actually imperil the health of patients.</p><p>The interests of politicians and the medical-industrial complex continually trump those of patients, seducing the wealthy with unnecessary procedures and leaving the poor with haphazard access to treatment. Backward economic incentives allow patients with chronic conditions to receive ineffective care, and roll after roll of red tape undermines even the best-intentioned doctors. Tens of thousands of patients die each year from overtreatment. American medicine is in desperate need of fixing.</p><p>Nevertheless, <i>Overtreated</i> ultimately conveys a message of hope by reframing the debate over health care reform. Americans worry about rationing&#x2015;that any effort to rein in the high cost of health care will result in limited access to life-saving treatments. Covering the uninsured seems like an insurmountable problem because it will drive up costs even more. <i>Overtreated </i>offers a way to control costs and cover the uninsured, while simultaneously improving the quality of American medicine. Shannon Brownlee's humane, intelligent, and penetrating analysis empowers readers to avoid the perils of overtreatment, as well as pointing the way to better health care for everyone.</p></p><p><p><b>Shannon Brownlee</b> is an award-winning journalist whose stories and essays about medicine, health care, and biotechnology have appeared in such publications as the<i> Atlantic Monthly</i>, the<i> New York Times Magazine</i>, the<i> New Republic</i>, and <i>Time</i>.

In gripping detail, Shannon Brownlee explains how well-insured Americans get much more high-tech medical care -- CT scans, angiograms, and the like -- than they need, enriching the hospitals and doctors who provide it, but driving up the overall costs of health care and often endangering patients' lives. Brownlee clearly shows in this important book that overtreatment, like undertreatment, is very bad medicine.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marcia Angell, senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School and former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Overtreated</i> will scare you.

She will forever change the way you view health care while restoring your hope for its future.

E. B. DuBois&#39; The Talented Tenth. He is also the editor of the landmark anthology Go the Way Your Blood Beats (1996).In a 1984 Village Voice interview, James Baldwin said, "The best advice I ever got was from an old friend of mine... who said you have to go the way your blood beats." As editor Ruff translates it, this means "live life instinctively, intuitively, with integrity and an awareness of consequences, and without self deception." Organized by themes, this rich array of short stories and novel excerpts ranges from thoroughly enjoyable conventional narrative like Harris's captivating chapter from Just As I Am about homophobia in black fraternities to accounts of personal liberation that border on magical realism such as Bruce Marrow's "Near the End of the World," about a young gay man who finds consolation for the loss of his gay father in the company of a half-crazy Smith alumna cum tattoo artist on the Venice boardwalk. In Becky Birtha's "Ice Castle," a young woman contends with her parents disapproval and her own bewildering infatuation with an underage upper-class white girl. In Gayl Jones's "The Women," a young girl recalls her mother's revolving door of lesbian lovers. Although many of the stories transcend color to strike universal chords, it is perhaps inevitable that the collection concentrates so much more on pain than on pleasure, self-knowledge or liberation. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nomads and the Outside World</h2><p><p>Hailed by reviewers as &#x201c;majestic and magisterial,&#x201d; Nomads and the Outside World was first published in English in 1984.&nbsp; With the author's new introduction and an updated bibliography, this classic is now available in an edition accessible to students.</p><br><br><p>From reviews of the first edition:</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Magisterial.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; Combining a phenomenal erudition, a candid judgment, and a subtle sense of irony, Khazanov sets out to challenge the orthodox view of nomadic feudalism and, in the process, has produced the first comparative survey of pastoral societies that can claim to be truly comprehensive, covering their history in Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa from the origins of pastoralism to the dawn of the modern era.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tim Ingold,</p><i>Current Anthropology</i><br><br><p>&#x201c;This is the best study on pastoral nomadism that the reviewer has ever read.&nbsp; At last we have a major attempt to present the whole phenomenon in historical, ecological, spatial and structural perspective.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; Superb scholarship.&nbsp; It is the kind of work that can only be produced as a result of years of specific research, much deep thinking&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; and a determination to reject cant.&#x201d;&#x2014;John C.

He manages to provide an educational and eye-opening account of a country's political turmoil--in this case, Afghanistan--while also developing characters whose heartbreaking struggles and emotional triumphs resonate with readers long after the last page has been turned over. And he does this on his first try.<p> <i>The Kite Runner</i> follows the story of Amir, the privileged son of a wealthy businessman in Kabul, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant. As children in the relatively stable Afghanistan of the early 1970s, the boys are inseparable. They spend idyllic days running kites and telling stories of mystical places and powerful warriors until an unspeakable event changes the nature of their relationship forever, and eventually cements their bond in ways neither boy could have ever predicted. Even after Amir and his father flee to America, Amir remains haunted by his cowardly actions and disloyalty. In part, it is these demons and the sometimes impossible quest for forgiveness that bring him back to his war-torn native land after it comes under Taliban rule. ("...I wondered if that was how forgiveness budded, not with the fanfare of epiphany, but with pain gathering its things, packing up, and slipping away unannounced in the middle of the night.")</p><p> Some of the plot's turns and twists may be somewhat implausible, but Hosseini has created characters that seem so real that one almost forgets that <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a novel and not a memoir. At a time when Afghanistan has been thrust into the forefront of America's collective consciousness ("people sipping lattes at Starbucks were talking about the battle for Kunduz"), Hosseini offers an honest, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, but always heartfelt view of a fascinating land. Perhaps the only true flaw in this extraordinary novel is that it ends all too soon. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p>"A wonderful work... This is one of those unforgettable stories that stay with you for years. All the great themes of literature and of life are the fabric of this extraordinary novel: love, honor, guilt, fear redemption...It is so powerful that for a long time everything I read after seemed bland." -- Isabel Allende <br>&nbsp; <br>"Stunning . . . an incisive, perceptive examination of recent Afghan history. . . It is rare that a book is at once so timely and of such high literary quality." -- <i>Publisher's Weekly</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;In <b>The Kite Runner</b>, Khaled Hosseini gives us a vivid and engaging story that reminds us how long his people have been struggling to triumph over the forces of violence -- forces that continue to threaten them even today.&#x201d; -- <i>New York Times</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A haunting morality tale.&#x201d; -- <i>USA Today</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;His passionate story of betrayal and redemption is framed by Afghanistan&#x2019;s tragic recent past . . . Rather than settle for a coming-of-age or travails-of-immigrants story, Hosseini has folded them both into this searing spectacle of hard-won personal salvation. All this, and a rich slice of Afghan culture too: irresistible." -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Like <b>Gone with the Wind</b>, this extraordinary first novel locates the personal struggles of everyday people in the terrible sweep of history.&#x201d; -- <i>People</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;To many Western readers, [Afghanistan&#x2019;s] can be an exhausting and bewildering history. But Hosseini extrudes it into an intimate account of family and friendship, betrayal and salvation that requires no atlas or translation to engage and enlighten us.&#x201d; -- <i>Washington Post</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Hosseini does tenderness and terror, California dream and Kabul nightmare with equal aplomb. . .a ripping yarn and ethical parable.&#x201d; -- <i>Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>"A beautiful novel . . . a song in a new key.

Martin Dillon is recognised for non-fiction (The Shankill Butchers, God and the Gun.)</p><h2>Jesus Is Not a Republican: The Religious Right&#39;s War on America</h2><p>The historical Jesus, by most accounts, was in favor of social justice, peace and compassion. Right wing radicals, including the social conservatives allied with the Republican Party, exploit the name of Jesus to support policies that lead to injustice, war and cruelty. Jesus Is Not a Republican includes several dozen essays and articles, including several original essays, by some of today&#39;s most thoughtful spiritual and political thinkers. Rob Boston of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State uncovers the hypocrisy of the Christian Right. Reporter Jeffrey Sharlet goes undercover as a true believer in &#34;the Family&#34;, a shadowy, politically well-connected group of fundamentalists with dubious motives. Jim Wallis, founder of Sojourners, explains the Bible&#39;s call to work for social justice. Together, they make the case that the religious right has strayed far from a truly Christian path, and reviews the achievements of progressive Christians who actually try to follow the teachings of Jesus. The upshot is that a true follower of Jesus is far more likely to vote for a liberal Democrat than for a conservative Republican.</p><p></p><h2>The Making of Minjung: Democracy and the Politics of Representation in South Korea</h2><p><p>In this sweeping intellectual and cultural history of the minjung ("common people's") movement in South Korea, Namhee Lee shows how the movement arose in the 1970s and 1980s in response to the repressive authoritarian regime and grew out of a widespread sense that the nation's "failed history" left Korean identity profoundly incomplete. The Making of Minjung captures the movement in its many dimensions, presenting its intellectual trajectory as a discourse and its impact as a political movement, as well as raising questions about how intellectuals represented the minjung. Lee's portrait is based on a wide range of sources: underground pamphlets, diaries, court documents, contemporary newspaper reports, and interviews with participants.</p><p>Thousands of students and intellectuals left universities during this period and became factory workers, forging an intellectual-labor alliance perhaps unique in world history. At the same time, minjung cultural activists reinvigorated traditional folk theater, created a new "minjung literature," and influenced religious practices and academic disciplines. In its transformative scope, the minjung phenomenon is comparable to better-known contemporaneous movements in South Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. </p><p>Understanding the minjung movement is essential to understanding South Korea's recent resistance to U.S. influence. Along with its well-known economic transformation, South Korea has also had a profound social and political transformation. The minjung movement drove this transformation, and this book tells its story comprehensively and critically.</p></p><p>"A tour de force! <i>The Making of Minjung</i> puts the South Korean struggles for democracy and social justice on the world historical stage. An answer to the postcolonial predicament, a movement, and a transformative public sphere, minjung emerges as a remarkable historical constellation. Namhee Lee's is that sort of history of the present that takes us into the future."--Nancy Abelmann, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <p> "In <i>The Making of Minjung</i>, which is notable for its evenhandedness, Namhee Lee has given us what will become the standard work on the confluence of political, economic, and social forces underlying South Korea's transition from military dictatorship to a flourishing democracy."--Donald N. Clark, Trinity University </p><p> "<i>The Making of Minjung</i> is a pathbreaking book on an important movement in Korea's contemporary social and political history. It is extremely well researched, full of new insights, and true to the lived realities of student activists and their allies in Korea's democratic development."--Joseph Wong, University of Toronto</p><p>Namhee Lee is Associate Professor of Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p></p><h2>Black Monday: The Catastrophe of October 19, 1987 ... and Beyond</h2><p>Presents a thorough financial report on the events leading up to the 1988 stock crash, its aftermath, and the reverberations of the catastrophe on Wall Street and around the world</p><p></p><h2>Printmaking: A Contemporary Perspective</h2><p>Printmaking: A Contemporary Perspective is a solid overview of current work in this exciting area, taking into account the history and the different techniques available for artists working today.

Matthew Dennis employs methods and materials from a range of disciplines, including archaeology, ethnology, folklore, literary criticism, and history, to reconstruct those worlds and analyze the consequences of their mingling with one another.

A junkie robs the notoriously hardboiled detective at knifepoint. A fight on a subway platform comes close to pushing him in front of a train. While any one of these could be a coincidence, together they make a conspiracy&#x2014;one that Hammer will have to end in order to survive.

Now these eight short stories, collected and finished by Max Allan Collins, show that Spillane is still capable of redefining the genre.<br><br> The stories in <i>A Long Time Dead</i> have received numerous accolades, including an Edgar Award nomination, &nbsp;two International Association of Media and Tie-in Writers &#x201c;Scribe&#x201d; Awards, and a Private Eye Writers of America&nbsp;Shamus Award.</p><p>Mickey Spillane (1918&#x2013;2006) was an American crime writer. Many of his novels featured the detective Mike Hammer. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Spillane sold his first story to a pulp magazine by the time he graduated from high school. He served as a fighter pilot in the army air corps in World War II, and published his first novel, <i>I, the Jury</i>, in 1947. With over two hundred twenty-five million copies of his books sold internationally, Spillane ranks as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular mystery writers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Max Allan Collins is an award-winning writer of mysteries, comics, thrillers, screenplays, and historical fiction. His graphic novel <i>Road to Perdition</i> was the basis for the 2002 Academy Award&#x2013;winning film by the same name. Collins cofounded the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers and studied at the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop. He collaborated with Mickey Spillane on several projects and is completing a number of the Mike Hammer novels that Spillane left unfinished. Collins lives in Iowa with his wife, author Barbara Collins.&#x201c;Collins channels Spillane&#x2019;s thinking and writing, a combination that results in smart plots, smart-alecky asides and conclusions that stun and satisfy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Here, amid the rolling hills of southeastern Pennsylvania, visitors can pass through the house which served as Washington's Headquarters during the famous winter encampment of 1777&#x2013;1778. Others picnic and jog in the huge park, complete with monuments, recreated log huts, and modern visitor center, all built to pay tribute to the Valley Forge story. </p><p>In this lively book, Lorett Treese shows how Valley Forge evolved into the tourist mecca that it is today. In the process, she uses Valley Forge as a means for understanding how Americans view their own past. Treese explores the origins of popular images associated with Valley Forge, such as George Washington kneeling in the snow to seek divine assistance. She places Valley Forge in the context of the historic preservation movement as the site became Pennsylvania's first state park in 1893. She studies its "Era of Monuments" and the movement to "restore" Valley Forge in the spirit of Rockefeller's enormously popular colonial Williamsburg. </p><p>Treese describes a Valley Forge fraught with controversy over the appropriate appearance and use of a place so revered. One such controversy, the "hot dog war," a brief but intense battle over concession stands, was spawned by Americans' changing perceptions of how a national park was to be used. The volatile Vietnam era prompted the state park commission to establish its "Subcommittee on Sex, Hippies, and Whiskey Swillers" to investigate park regulation infractions. Even today, people differ over exactly what happened at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777&#x2013;1778. The modern visitor sees the remains of over a century of commemoration, competition, and contention. The result, Treese shows, is a historic site that may reveal more about succeeding history than about Washington's army. This book will give its readers a new way to look at Valley Forge&#x2014;and all historic sites.</p></p><p><p>Lorett Treese is the College Archivist at Bryn Mawr College. She is the author of <em>The Storm Gathering: The Penn Family and the American Revolution </em>(Penn State, 1992).</p>&#x201c;A few decades after the Revolutionary War, Valley Forge was a largely ignored battlefield that was rapidly reverting to farmland; this year as many as four million tourists will visit the site. Thus, it is both instructive and interesting to follow the evolution of this national shrine. Treese, an archivist at Bryn Mawr College, has a knack for breathing life into seemingly dry and fragmented documentary evidence. She skillfully examines lore about Valley Forge, including Washington&#x2019;s supposed pleas for divine guidance and the striking image of snow stained with the blood of shoeless, starving soldiers. She also reveals the often passionate conflicts and rivalries over development and concession rights. Finally, she paints a revealing portrait of the manner in which Americans, past and present, have chosen to view their history. In an age when the bloodstained, hallowed ground of Virginia battlefields is coveted as a site for a Disney theme park, Treese&#x2019;s work is a timely reminder that some treasures can&#x2019;t be calculated in dollars and cents.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;All in all, this is a very solid book that should provide good information and interesting reading for varied audiences.

This fifth, enlarged edition includes marginal notations made by Heidegger in his personal copy of the book and four new appendices&#x2015;Heidegger's postpublication notes on the book, his review of Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, Heidegger's response to reviews by rudolf Odebrecht and Cassirer, and an essay "On the History of the Philosophical Chair since 1866." The work is significant not only for its illuminating assessment of Kant&#x2019;s thought but also for its elaboration of themes first broached in Being and Time, especially the problem of how Heidegger proposed to enact his destruction of the metaphysical tradition and the role that his reading of Kant would play therein.</p></p><p><p>Richard Taft is former Research Fellow at Trinity College, Hartford, and former Fulbright Fellow at the Hegel Archive of the Ruhr University in Germany.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Big Ideas Math: Modeling Real Life - (Grade 4) Student Edition (Volume 1)</h2><p>Big Ideas Math: Modeling Real Life - (Grade 4) Student Edition (Volume 1) By Ron Larson (Author), Laurie Boswell Product details Format: Paperback Publisher: National Geog School Pub; 1 edition (13 April 2018) Language: English ISBN-10: 1635988896 ISBN-13: 9781635988895</p><p></p><h2>The Year&#39;s Work in Lebowski Studies (The Year&#39;s Work: Studies in Fan Culture and Cultural Theory)</h2><p><p>A massive underground sensation, <i>The Big Lebowski </i>has been hailed as the first cult film of the internet age.

Steichen, who died just short of his ninety-fourth birthday, was fifty and internationally famous when Steichen the Photographer was written by his brother-in-law, the poet and biographer Carl Sandburg. Now Penelope Niven, whose highly acclaimed biography of Sandburg appeared in 1991, has written the first comprehensive biography of Steichen.<br><br>Here, she illuminates the full story of Steichen's avant-garde life in Paris and New York and his roles in introducing modern art to the American audience, in shaping aerial reconnaissance photography in World War I and navy photography in World War II, in revolutionizing American fashion and portrait photography through his years as chief of photography at Vanity Fair and Vogue, and in creating the unprecedented photographic exhibition The Family of Man, which has touched a global audience of millions since it opened in 1955.<br><br>Searching the world over for Steichen's letters, paintings, and photographs, Niven has reconstructed his major, pioneering achievements. Steichen's enduring contributions to the fine art of photography have not been fully recognized because they have not, until now, been fully documented and placed within the context of his times and his turbulent, romantic, and often tragic personal life.<br><br>With the help of public and private papers and interviews, Niven builds a compelling portrait of the charismatic, complex, very human man behind the camera. We explore Steichen's gardens and his artful love of nature, manifested in his obsessive achievements as a master breeder of delphinium. We step inside his intimate, private world--and view his passionate attachment to his mother, his sister, and his two daughters; the heartrending battles of his first marriage; and his alleged and actual love affairs. This biography also explores Steichen's catalytic relationships with August Rodin, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Alfred Stieglitz, Gertrude and Leo Stein, and Carl and Lilian Steichen Sandburg. <br><br>"Steichen was a rebel, stubbornly independent and largely self-taught, who also believed passionately in the fundamental intersections of art and life," Penelope Niven writes. As this biography reveals, Edward Steichen's life, like his art, was brilliantly original, dramatic, and unforgettable.</p><p>From his legendary association with Alfred Stieglitz in the groundbreaking 291 Gallery to his selection of photographs for <i>The Family of Man</i> exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, Edward Steichen (1879-1973) stood at the forefront of artistic innovation in America and Europe. Penelope Niven, biographer of Carl Sandburg (Steichen's brother-in-law), affectionately depicts her subject. She carefully assesses Steichen's three marriages, his supportive relationships with other artists, and the humanistic vision that informed his photography. Her comprehensive study reminds us of Steichen's central role in elevating photography to a crucial 20th-century art form."A powerful and much-needed portrayal of a major American writer and social critic."<br>--New York Times Book Review<br><br>"An extraordinarily fine biography." <br> --St. Louis Dispatch<br><br>"Niven's groundbreaking work captures the epic sweep of Sandburg's life . . . with authority . . . and her examination of Sandburg's relationships with his wife and daughters is both sensitive and probing."<br>--Chicago Sun-Times<br><br>"Niven has succeeded admirably in writing a book that should appeal to scholars and to general readers."<br>--Atlanta Constitution<br><br>"Penelope Niven's life of Carl Sandburg is indispensible."<br>--Karl Shapiro, Chicago Tribune<br><br>"Wonderfully written . . .

She knew that she should not stare at his nose; she had been taught by her aunt that she should never pay attention to any obvious physical feature. <i>People come in different shapes and sizes, </i>Annie said. <i>Don&#x2019;t make it awkward for them.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>She wrested her gaze away from the farmer&#x2019;s nose and looked into his eyes, wondering what age he was. She was nineteen&#x2014;twenty in a couple of months&#x2014;and it was still difficult for her to judge the age of those even a decade older than she was. He was in his late fifties somewhere, she thought. His eyes, she noticed, were grey, and clear too; they were those of one who was used to the open, to wind and weather, to open spaces. They were a countryman&#x2019;s eyes, accustomed to looking at things that were really important: sheep, cattle, the ploughed earth&#x2014;things that a farmer saw, and understood. She spotted these things; she may not have had much formal education&#x2014;she had left school at sixteen, as many did&#x2014;but she saw things that other people failed to see, and she understood them. They said at school that she could have gone much further, as she was of above average intelligence&#x2014;a &#x201c;thoughtful, articulate girl,&#x201d; the principal had written; &#x201c;the sort of talent this country wastes so carelessly.&#x201d; University, even, had been a possibility, but there had not been much money, and she had found the thought of going away was daunting.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Spit on your hands, Val,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Like this, see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He spat on his right hand first, then the left. &#x201c;Then you rub them together,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;Not too much, mind, or it won&#x2019;t work. You try now. You show me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She smiled, and looked down at her hands. They were already dirty from salvaging hessian sacks in one of the barns to stack them ready for use&#x2014;nothing was wasted these days, old string, rusty nails, scraps of wood&#x2014;everything could be put to some use. Her hands were still soft, though, and he had noticed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mind if I call you Val?&#x201d; asked the farmer. &#x201c;It would be a bit of a mouthful to call you Miss . . .&#x201d; He trailed away, looking momentarily embarrassed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Eliot. Miss Eliot. No, Val is who I am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And you should call me Archie. Full name Archibald, of course, but nobody ever used that&#x2014;apart from my mother. Mothers usually call their sons by their proper names. I knew a lad at school who was called Skinny by everybody&#x2014;he was that thin&#x2014;but his mother always called him Terence.&#x201d; He shook his head at the memory. &#x201c;Not much of a name, Terence, if you ask me. A town name, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She laughed. &#x201c;My aunt sometimes calls me Valerie. Same thing, I suppose.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;So I should spit on my hands when I&#x2019;m picking things?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, if you like. But mostly when you&#x2019;re using a spade. The handle can be hard on your hands. I&#x2019;ve seen young lads get blisters the size of a half-crown from spades.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She promised to be careful, and to remember to do as he said. There was so much to learn: she had been on the farm for only three days, and she had already learned eighteen things. She had written them all down in her land girl&#x2019;s diary, each one numbered, with its explanation written in pencil. Eighteen new pieces of information as to how to work the land; about how to be a farmer.<br>&nbsp;<br>They had been standing in the yard, directly outside the larger of the two barns. Now the farmer suggested that if she came to the farmhouse kitchen he would make tea for both of them. She should take a break every four hours, he said. &#x201c;Take fifteen minutes to get your breath back. It&#x2019;s more efficient that way&#x2014;at least in the long run. A tired man . . . sorry, a tired girl too . . . gets less done than one who&#x2019;s well rested. I&#x2019;ve always said that. I told young Phil that. He was one for working all hours, but I told him not to.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He had mentioned Phil on the first day. He had explained that he was his nephew, the son of his older brother, who had helped him on the farm for almost a year, and had gone off to join the army two months earlier. &#x201c;He saw through Hitler,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Even when he was a nipper, fourteen, fifteen, he said &#x2018;Hitler&#x2019;s trouble.&#x2019; And he was right, wasn&#x2019;t he? Spot on. Look where we are now. Hitler sitting in all those countries&#x2014;France, Holland, them places&#x2014;and if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the Yanks coming in we&#x2019;d be on our knees, begging for mercy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He had welcomed her, because with Phil gone he would not have been able to cope. The farm was not a large one&#x2014;eighty-five acres&#x2014;but it was intensively cultivated and it would have been too much for him to manage by himself. That was where the Women&#x2019;s Land Army came in: they said they would send him one of their land girls, and they sent her, riding on her bicycle from the village six miles away. She lived there with her aunt Annie, the local postmistress. Archie knew Annie slightly, as the local postmistress was friendly with everybody. He must have seen Val about the place, too, but had not noticed her. He did not pay much attention to women and girls; he was a shy man, who had never married, and tended to feel awkward in female company. But he liked Val; on that very first day he had decided that here was a well brought up girl who knew her manners and was not going to be afraid of hard work. She would earn her two pounds four shillings a week, he thought. It was a decent wage if you did not have to give up some of it for board and lodging&#x2014;and he assumed she did not have to pay Annie for lodging, although she probably contributed something for her food. She might even be able to save&#x2014;if she stayed the course, which he had a feeling she would do. If they had sent him somebody from town, it could be a very different story. He knew somebody who had been allocated a land girl from London and she barely knew that milk came from cows; there was no work in her, he had been told, just complaints about mud and requests for time off every other day. He would not have a girl like that about the place; he would refuse, and they couldn&#x2019;t make him take her, even with their powers to tell you to do this and that, as if the Ministry of Agriculture knew how to run a farm. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So, Val Eliot,&#x201d; he said as he poured her mug of tea. &#x201c;Tell me a little more about yourself. Where are your mum and dad?&#x201d; He immediately regretted the question. He should not have asked her that, and he became flustered.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was relieved that she did not seem upset. &#x201c;My dad went to Australia,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That was twelve years ago, when I was seven. My mum died five years ago.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Well, at least she was not an orphan; that would have made his question all the more tactless. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about your mum,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My aunt is her sister,&#x201d; said Val. &#x201c;She took me in. My dad sends money, sometimes, or did until last year, when I turned eighteen. But my aunt was all right with that. She says that my dad isn&#x2019;t a bad man; he&#x2019;s just not the sort to settle down. He moved around in Australia. He&#x2019;s a roofer. They have a lot of tin roofs out there.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;You want to see a photograph of them? Of my mum and dad?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He nodded, and she crossed the kitchen to the peg where he had told her she could hang the jacket and scarf she wore when cycling from the village. She took out a purse, and extracted from it a small photograph. The photograph had been posted onto a card for protection.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s them,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Before he left for Australia.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He looked at the picture of the man and woman standing outside a shop front. They were holding hands, dressed in their Sunday best, the man with one of those stiff, uncomfortable collars, the woman with a blouse that buttoned up to her neck.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She has a kind face,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I like her smile.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My aunt says that my mum always smiled. All the time. She said that even when she felt low about something, she still smiled.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the attitude,&#x201d; said Archie. &#x201c;No use being down in the dumps. That never makes anything any easier.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think that too,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Archie looked at her with admiration. If he had ever had a daughter, she would be something like this girl, he thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>That fellow who went off to Australia&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t deserve a daughter like this.<br>&nbsp;<br>*<br>&nbsp;<br>She was still working at six, when Archie told her she could stop.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You should be getting home now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Lots of light still, but you&#x2019;ll be needing your tea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She stood up, brushing the earth from her fingers. She had been weeding a line of cabbages and her knees and her back were sore from the bending.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a watch,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It broke.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He smiled. &#x201c;No need for watches on a farm. There&#x2019;s the sun. It comes up and you know that&#x2019;s morning. Goes down and you know it&#x2019;s night. Simple, really.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He walked back with her towards the farmhouse. While she collected her scarf and coat, he made his way into a shed and emerged with a basket.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got three eggs here for you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Fresh today. The hens are laying well. I think they like you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She had fed the hens that morning, and they had pecked and fluttered about her feet, desperate for the grain; silly creatures, she thought, with their fussing and clucking about nothing very much. Now she peered into the basket; he had wrapped each egg in a twist of newspaper, but she could see they were of a generous size. The ration was one egg a week for each person, and here were three.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re very kind,&#x201d; she said, taking the basket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring the basket back tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He nodded. &#x201c;You say hello to your aunt from me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I shall.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And ride carefully down that lane. Those trucks from the base sometimes come this way and they don&#x2019;t know how to drive, half of them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be careful.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It took her forty minutes to reach the village. There were no cars&#x2014;not a single one&#x2014;and no trucks. This was deep England, far away from any big town, a self-contained world of secret, hedge-marked fields and short distances. Wheeling her bicycle into the back yard, she leaned it against the wall of the shed. Then she went inside, the eggs her trophy, proudly held before her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Annie kissed her. &#x201c;Clever girl,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You must be working hard for him to treat you to those.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a kind man, Auntie.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Annie agreed. &#x201c;Everyone speaks highly of Archie Wilkinson.&#x201d; She began to unwrap the eggs. &#x201c;They say he wanted to get married but never did. Too much work to do. Never got away from that farm of his.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;It could still happen, of course. But look at these eggs: lovely brown shells. Look.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Val examined one of the eggs. &#x201c;Made so perfectly, aren&#x2019;t they? So smooth.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;One each,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Coddled? A coddled egg is hard to beat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Val nodded. &#x201c;Is Willy in yet?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Willy was a relative&#x2014;a distant connection by marriage&#x2014;who had been staying with Annie for the last year. He was working on the land, too, although the farm to which he had been sent, a farm that belonged to a man called Ted Butters, was further away, and by all accounts very different from Archie&#x2019;s place. Not that they heard much about it from Willy, who was not very bright and forgot things easily. He was two years older than Val and had never been able to have a proper job. He had come to live with Annie when he had been sent to work on the farm, which was more or less all he could do.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no danger of the army coming for Willy,&#x201d; Annie had observed. &#x201c;Poor boy, but at least he&#x2019;s not going to have to put on a uniform. He&#x2019;d never cope with army life.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Val got on well with Willy&#x2014;it would be hard not to. She liked his openness, and his innocent, generous smile. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s very gentle,&#x201d; she said to a friend who enquired about the rather ungainly young man she had seen coming out of the post office. &#x201c;Willy wouldn&#x2019;t hurt a fly. But there&#x2019;s not much he can do, really. He can pick potatoes and things like that, and precious little else.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now Annie said, &#x201c;Willy will like this egg. He loves eggs, doesn&#x2019;t he? I bet that farmer up there will not be giving him much. Mean piece of work.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Half an hour later they sat down at the kitchen table. Annie served the coddled eggs with pieces of bread on which she had scraped a thin layer of dripping.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This is a real feast,&#x201d; said Val.<br>&nbsp;<br>Willy beamed with pleasure. &#x201c;I like eggs,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Always have.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Val washed up, with the wireless on in the background. She listened to the announcer with his grave, clipped voice. Bad news given in measured tones could even sound reassuring. Willy, of course, only half grasped what was happening. &#x201c;The desert&#x2019;s very dry,&#x201d; he remarked. &#x201c;Where do they get the water for the tanks?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oases,&#x201d; said Annie. It suddenly occurred to her that he might be thinking of water tanks, rather than armoured tanks. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t you worry about that, Willy.&#x201d;</p><h2>Jane Boleyn: The True Story of the Infamous Lady Rochford</h2><p>In a life of extraordinary drama, Jane Boleyn was catapulted from relative obscurity to the inner circle of King Henry VIII. As powerful men and women around her became victims of Henry&#x2019;s ruthless and absolute power, including her own husband and sister-in-law, Queen Anne Boleyn, Jane&#x2019;s allegiance to the volatile monarchy was sustained and rewarded. But the price for her loyalty would eventually be her undoing and the ruination of her name. For centuries, little beyond rumor and scandal has been associated with &#x201c;the infamous Lady Rochford.&#x201d; But now historian Julia Fox sets the record straight and restores dignity to this much-maligned figure whose life and reputation were taken from her.<br><br>Born to aristocratic parents in the English countryside, young Jane Parker found a suitable match in George Boleyn, brother to Anne, the woman who would eventually be the touchstone of England&#x2019;s greatest political and religious crisis. Once settled in the bustling, spectacular court of Henry VIII as the wife of a nobleman, Jane was privy to the regal festivities of masques and jousts, royal births and funerals, and she played an intimate part in the drama and gossip that swirled around the king&#x2019;s court. <br><br>But it was Anne Boleyn&#x2019;s descent from palace to prison that first thrust Jane into the spotlight. Impatient with Anne&#x2019;s inability to produce a male heir, King Henry accused the queen of treason and adultery with a multitude of men, including her own brother, George. Jane was among those interrogated in the scandal, and following two swift strokes from the executioner&#x2019;s blade, she lost her husband and her sister-in-law, her inheritance and her place in court society.<br><br>Now the thirty-year-old widow of a traitor, Jane had to ensure her survival and protect her own interests by securing land and income. With sheer determination, she navigated her way back into royal favor by becoming lady-in-waiting to Henry&#x2019;s three subsequent brides, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, and Catherine Howard. At last Jane&#x2019;s future seemed secure&#x2013;until an unwitting misstep involving the sexual intrigues of young Queen Catherine destroyed the life and reputation Jane worked so hard to rebuild.<br><br>Drawing upon her own deep knowledge and years of original research, Julia Fox brings us into the inner sanctum of court life, laced with intrigue and encumbered by disgrace. Through the eyes and ears of Jane Boleyn, we witness the myriad players of the stormy Tudor period. Jane emerges as a courageous spirit, a modern woman forced by circumstances to fend for herself in a privileged but vicious world.</p><p>After graduating from the University of London, Julia Fox taught history in both public and private schools for a number of years, specializing in the Tudors and in nineteenth-century Britain and Europe. She currently lives in London with her husband, the historian John Guy, and their two cats. Jane Boleyn is her first book.Chapter 1 <br><br>Childhood<br><br>It was time to go. The horses shifted and stamped restlessly. They always seemed to know when a long journey was imminent. The carts were laden with fashionable clothes, domestic items, everything needed to make life comfortable. Servants and escorts were ready too. For Lord Morley&#x2019;s daughter, Jane Parker, a new life was about to begin. She rode out toward London, leaving her family home at Great Hallingbury behind.<br><br>Until now, the Tudor mansion built by Lord Morley had been her world. The solid, red-bricked house replaced an earlier Morley dwelling that had nestled in the same Essex village for over three hundred years. It was huge, a magical place for giggling children to hide and play. Scattered among the richly carved oak furniture and plate inside the building were many reminders of Lord Morley&#x2019;s mother, Alice Lovel. When she died in 1518, Alice made generous bequests to her son. Lord Morley could sleep in the bed of cloth of gold and tawny velvet she left him. He could sit in her &#x201c;best chair,&#x201d; which stood in the long gallery that Morley equipped with expensive linenfold paneling and tall, graceful windows. Alice&#x2019;s gilt bowl emblazoned with her own coat of arms as well as that of her first husband&#x2019;s was on display for all to see. An even older and more precious heirloom was the special cup with its gilt cover, which Alice said was &#x201c;gotten&#x201d; by her ancestors. That too was on view. One of the exquisitely embroidered wall hangings also came from her. Lord Morley had been allowed to choose whichever one he wanted from her estate. Everything fitted perfectly into his newly constructed home, which was one of the finest in the county. Its grounds were impressive too. If the weather was fine, Jane roamed happily outside in the carefully tended gardens, which stretched for over two acres. There was an orchard to provide apples, pears, and quinces for the quince marmalade that everyone loved. There was a pond surrounded by trees and stocked with fish. There was a long brick stable block and hay loft, so necessary for the Morley horses, surmounted by tall red Tudor chimneys. Whether Great Hallingbury (or Hallingbury Morley, as her father preferred to call it) was snuggling under thick snow or basking in the warm sunshine of a summer&#x2019;s afternoon, the setting was idyllic, especially during those few precious years of childhood when time passes slowly and growing up seems so far away.<br><br>Just a short walk across the fields from the house was the parish church of St. Giles. It is still standing. Built largely of flint and limestone, and with a square bell tower, the church was small and intimate. The nave, forty-five feet long, with circular windows set deeply into the walls, led into the chancel through a round arch constructed of Roman bricks, for there had once been a Roman site here. It was probably in this pretty church, so much the heart of the village, that Jane was baptized. About the year 1505, the tiny girl was carried to the porch of St. Giles by her mother&#x2019;s midwife. Lady Morley was not present as it was customary for mothers not to reenter society until they had been churched or purified about forty days after giving birth. With Jane&#x2019;s godparents at her side, the midwife gently took her inside for the baptism itself. There, at the stone font, before the richly carved rood screen and amid the painted walls and brightly colored statues of saints, the baby was welcomed into the great Catholic fold. Lord and Lady Morley knew how important it was to have babies received into the protection of the church as quickly as possible after their birth. Life was unpredictable and diseases often struck without warning; they did not want their little daughter to fall into limbo, the dreadful nothingness that awaited the souls of unbaptized children. Everything, therefore, was correctly done. The priest blessed Jane with holy oil on her shoulders and chest, on her right hand and on her forehead. Salt was placed into her mouth so that she would be &#x201c;freed from all uncleanness, and from all assault of spiritual wickedness.&#x201d; She was dipped three times into the sacred water in the font. She was anointed with holy chrism. The godparents, whose names are lost to us, made their promises. They vowed to ensure that Jane&#x2019;s mother and father kept her &#x201c;from fire and water and other perils&#x201d; and to be certain that she knew &#x201c;the Pater noster, Ave and Creed, after the law of all holy church.&#x201d; They told the priest the name chosen for her: she was christened Jane, possibly after her father&#x2019;s sister, another Jane Parker. Family ties were always important.<br><br>As she rode away from these familiar surroundings, Jane knew just how important those ties were. She had every reason to feel pride in her lineage. Her father, Sir Henry Parker, Lord Morley, was a peer of the realm. He owned lands in Norfolk, Buckinghamshire, and Herefordshire as well as in Essex. He came from ancient stock. His ancestors had played their part in tumultuous events over the centuries, helping to quell the Peasants&#x2019; Revolt and fighting for king and country in the Hundred Years&#x2019; War against England&#x2019;s traditional enemy, France. Yes, Jane could feel proud.<br><br>Of course, she knew it could all have been otherwise. The family lands and title came through Jane&#x2019;s grandmother, Alice Lovel. Alice&#x2019;s brother, a previous Lord Morley, died in Flanders fighting for Edward IV. However, while he had died a hero, he also died without children so his entire estate went to Alice. Girls sometimes had their uses. But Alice&#x2019;s first marriage, to Sir William Parker, Jane&#x2019;s grandfather, brought the family close to disaster: Sir William Parker fought on the wrong side at the Battle of Bosworth. He supported the doomed Richard III against Henry Tudor, the victorious Henry VII. Sir William survived the battle but the new king never really trusted him. His son, the young Henry Parker, the future Lord Morley and Jane&#x2019;s father, was fortunate to have been brought up in the household of Lady Margaret Beaufort, Henry VII&#x2019;s mother.<br><br>Stern and formidable she might be, but Lady Margaret was loyal to those she took under her wing. She was particularly concerned that the little boy should receive what she felt was his due, especially when his mother remarried after Sir William&#x2019;s death. Lady Margaret paid five hundred marks (just under four hundred pounds) to Alice&#x2019;s new husband, Sir Edward Howard, to make sure that young Henry Parker kept some family land, presumably at Great Hallingbury. Sir Edward adhered to the bargain and also remembered his stepson in his will of 1512. He bequeathed the manor of Morley Hall in Norfolk to his wife, Alice, for her lifetime, after which it would pass to Jane&#x2019;s father. The legacy did not come without conditions, however. In exchange, Morley was required to give land worth ten marks a year to the prior and convent of Ingham in Norfolk or forfeit Morley Hall to them. Morley was lucky that Alice and Sir Edward had no children to complicate the situation even more. Sir Edward had sired two bastards for whom he did his best to provide: he asked the king to choose one; the other was allocated to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. Howard hoped their new guardians would be &#x201c;good&#x201d; lords to his sons, but as an extra safeguard he left the boys money to help them set &#x201c;forth in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>This did not, of course, affect Lord Morley or his inheritance. In fact, as far as Jane&#x2019;s father was concerned, the Howard marriage, which might have proved so awkward, brought him both land and valuable connections at court. The Howards were a very influential family. Sir Edward&#x2019;s father was the Duke of Norfolk, one of the leading men in the land, and Sir Edward&#x2019;s sister, Elizabeth, had married Sir Thomas Boleyn. Sir Thomas was a rising star, an ideal companion to the gregarious Henry VIII, certainly a man it was advantageous to know. And he was a neighbor, for the Boleyns owned lands in Essex and Norfolk just like the Morleys. Being linked to the Boleyns brought more associations since Thomas had sisters who married into other Norfolk or Essex families. His sister Anne, for example, married Sir John Shelton, Alice married Sir Robert Clere, and Margaret married Sir John Sackville. The inter- relationships were all very complicated but Lord Morley had every reason to believe that he and his family would gain from them. And Sir Thomas Boleyn had a son, George, who was more or less Jane&#x2019;s age. Who knew what time might bring?<br><br>Certainly, as she rode to London, Jane understood that her destiny lay outside the confines of Great Hallingbury. Even while she enjoyed those brief years of childhood, Jane realized that they were but a preparation for the future&#x2014;hers. Lord and Lady Morley took the upbringing of their children very seriously. It was their duty. Both boys and girls must be taught all that society demanded if they were to take their rightful place when the time came. Lord Morley had a love of learning that lasted all his life. Educated at Oxford himself, he wanted a stimulating and rigorous education for his son and heir, Henry. Expertise in the classics, though, was not something to encourage in his daughters. No husband would want a wife who was more knowledgeable than himself. And so Jane&#x2019;s schooling was designed to fit her for the role of a wife and mother. She stayed at home in those early years, learning how to read and write, how to supervise servants and run a large household, and how to harness the healing properties of common herbs so that she could treat everyday ailments. Then, of course, there was needlework. Jane spent hours quietly sewing and perfecting convoluted yet delicate stitches. In this she was not alone; most wealthy women excelled in this pastime. Even Queen Katherine made shirts for her husband and thought nothing of mending them herself as a sign of her love. Jane&#x2019;s favorite lessons, though, were ...</p><h2>Three Films by Woody Allen: Broadway Danny Rose, Zelig, Purple Rose of Cairo</h2><p>With stills from the movies themselves, this volume contains the screenplays of three Woody Allen films</p><p></p><h2>Louis the Fish (Reading Rainbow Book)</h2><p><p>Maurice Sendak greeted the publication of the first book by this unique author-and-artist team with an astonishing review in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, which began: "<i>Sid and Sol</i> is a wonder--a picture book that heralds a hopeful, healthy flicker of life in what is becoming a creatively exhausted genre.

What we experience in our daily lives often feels like anything <i>but</i> heaven. But what if we understood how powerful we are&#x2014;that we are powerful enough to mold both our internal and our external reality?<br><br><b>Anita Moorjani</b>, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Dying to Be Me</i>, is convinced we can do exactly that. The process, she explains, requires dismantling many cultural myths mistaken for indisputable truths. Beliefs such as &#x201c;We get what we deserve,&#x201d; &#x201c;Loving ourselves is selfish,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Coincidences are just that&#x2014;coincidences,&#x201d; are ingrained within us from birth, pervasive and influential, leading to generations of misguidance.<br><br> Following her near-death experience, Moorjani began to embody truths she learned in the other realm, discovering that letting go of these outmoded myths allowed her to experience heaven not as a physical place but as a state of mind, right here and right now. In this examination of our common myths, she shares stories and examples from her own life, revealing the lies beneath the surface of what she was taught and absorbed. By freeing ourselves from these falsehoods, Moorjani asserts, we can leave fear, heartache, and self-imposed boundaries behind and instead live lives full of purpose and joy.</p><p>Several of you have written to me saying "How can this possibly be heaven? If this is heaven, why does it feel like hell??" And I want to say that I'm actually not surprised by that reaction, and even when I came up with the title, I expected some of you to say that to me!! So let me explain. <b>Many years ago, my life was hell too</b>. I was bullied very badly as a child, and was taunted and discriminated against for the color of my skin and my family origin--something I had no control over. That really made my life miserable. And it certainly felt like hell when I was going through cancer, being in constant pain and fear for all those years.<br> <br> Life truly was a struggle for me, and I lived in immense fear for a huge part of my life. I had always believed that life happens to us. In other words, I believed that I was a victim of my circumstances, so I was always reacting to life instead of creating life. Of course I didn't believe I created my life circumstances. Who would create a childhood of bullying and discrimination, all of which shaped my thinking? Who would choose to be born as a woman into a culture that still believes women are inferior to men? Who would create cancer in their own life? Of course I was a victim of my circumstances. Or so I thought...until I "died".<br> <br>It's been 10 years since I faced death and came out the other side. Now when I look back at these past 10 years, I can see that my life is so drastically different from what it was prior, that I sometimes wonder whether I actually came back from death, or whether I'm still in the other realm. All the fear I used to have, all the pain, all the insecurity - they are all gone! So much so that I wonder whether I'm still dead and this is heaven! Every day, I get to do stuff I love to do! Of course this feels like heaven!<br> <br> But then I read the letters I have received over the last few years from so many of you, where you share your pain, and your fears. And also, I take a look around at the world around us. And it all brings me back down to earth. And I wonder, "Why can't we all create this state of heaven for ourselves? What is preventing us from doing it? Why did it take death for me to realize how to live my life? Isn't it a wasted life if people only learn the truth of how to live when they die?"<br> <br> Those are the questions that inspired me to write this book.<b> I don't want you to have to wait until you die to learn how to live. Remember, we are all connected, and I feel what you feel. This book comes from my heart to yours.</b><br> <br> Much Love,<br> <br> Anita<b>Anita Moorjani</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Dying to Be Me</i> (published by Hay House in 2012), an account of her nearly four-year battle with cancer that culminated in a fascinating and moving near-death experience in 2006, which vastly changed her perspective on life.

Overwhelmed by Pip&#39;s kindness the convict, unbeknownst to Pip, vows to make a fortune to finance Pip&#39;s rise to the upper classes. When, after several years, the convict returns to Pip to secure his help to escape England, their lives once again intertwine with tragic consequences. The novel presents one of Dickens&#39; most extreme caricatures in Miss Havisham, the wealthy dowager who wears only an old wedding dress and keeps all of her clocks stopped at the same time.Complications arise in Pip&#39;s love for the cold, but beautiful Estella, his misassumption that Miss Havisham is the mystery benefactor, and the tragic story of her broken heart and the men that influenced her life and her decision to raise Estella as a cold-hearted woman, full of contempt for men and for love. In &#39;Hard Times&#39; (1854), Dickens questions the materialism of the &#39;Age of Machinery&#39; in the scathing story of Thomas Gradgrind in the industrial nightmare of Coketown. Gradgrind teaches his children, Tom and Louisa, to stifle emotion and eschew frivolity and imagination, but unable to contain their natural instincts, Gradgrind is forced to accept the injustice of his philosophy, and the blame for their wasted lives.

Referring to Anvils in America is so common in blacksmithing and collecting circles that it is merely referred to as &#34;AIA&#34;. Want to know when your anvil was made? Refer to AIA. Want to identify the maker of your anvil and learn their history? Refer to AIA. Prior to AIA there were a few collectors of anvils and very few had an idea of what they had, how old or how rare. Today there are hundreds of anvil collectors and tool collectors that covet certain anvils. Antique anvils have become a hot item at sales and on ebay. There are now numerous private anvil museums. AIA is the single authoritative reference on anvils, their manufacture, history and lore. The early history of anvils starts with European makers, many long gone and now unknown.

This book is a companion to his erotic series, The Secret Paris of the 30s . A recreation of the 1933 edition, which did not appear here, it uses nearly all of Brassai's original plates and includes Paul Morand's original introductiona highly evocative travelogue narrative. The sensational, black-matted reproductions glow on the page, the effect heightened by the slight graininess characteristic of the process. Brassai's technique is so unobtrusive that we feel like unseen observers in the dark alleys, train yards, vegetable markets, and parks. Lighted by street lamps and devoid of crowds, it is a Paris few have seen. For photo-history collections.

St Oswald&#39;s Way begins at Heavenfield and its 97 miles take in rolling farmland and the Simonside Hills before reaching the vast sandy beaches of the coast. The 62 mile St Cuthbert&#39;s Way begins at Melrose and crosses the rugged crags and heather moorland of the Cheviot Hills. Both trails pass through Northumberland National Park to converge on atmospheric Lindisfarne (Holy Island), before continuing up the coast to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Each can be walked within a week, though there is scope for shortening or lengthening the stages to suit different itineraries. Also shown is the 64 mile Northumberland Coast Path from Cresswell to Berwick, which covers the entire length of the Northumberland Coast AONB. The guidebook is crammed with interesting snippets of information, alongside indispensable practical details of transport and accommodation in the area. Detailed route descriptions and clear, step-by-step instructions are accompanied by 1:50,000 OS mapping.</p><p>Rudolf Abraham was born in London and began travelling at an early age.

In <i>The World of the Early Christians,</i> Joseph Kelly introduces and explains the world of the early Christians, and while he examines the differences between our two societies, he also stresses our similarities. The early Christians were people, like us, trying to make their way in life.</p><p>There are many introductions to the world of the early Christians, but few if any deal with its historical background and the basic questions non-specialists ask: Why did the Christians use philosophy at al? Didn't it make everything confusing? Why didn't they just stay with the Bible? In <i>The World of the Early Christians</i> Kelly answers such preliminary questions and concentrates on the fundamental issue of <i>why</i> Christians used philosophy, rather than simply listing the philosophies they used.</p><p>Not only do most people know little about the early Christians, they often have erroneous views about them. For example, many modern Christians think their ancient spiritual ancestors were impoverished, uneducated people from the lowest strata of Roman society. <i>The World of the Early Christians</i> addresses some of these misconceptions by considering the historical evidence available about these people. Similarly, Kelly also explains some ancient topics - such as magic and astrology - and considers how they can be misleading to modern students. He then describes the early Christians' relationships with other groups, such as Jews, pagans, and members of popular and official cults, and then explores the intellectual and cultural lives of the early Christians.</p><p>Students and anyone interested in understanding the now lost world of early Christianity will appreciate this volume's straightforward treatment of this essential background material.</p><p>Kelly touches upon topics treated by the other volumes in the <i>Message of the Fathers of the Church</i> series. He refers to original sources in translation unless no translation is available, and he includes bibliographic references for further research. In a direct and easy manner, Kelly brings to life for us today the rich world of the early Christians.</p><p>Chapters are: "Who Were the Early Christians?" "How Do We Know About the Early Christians?" "The Physical World," "Others," "Intellectual and Cultural Life," "Living in the World," and "A Brief History of Early Christianity."</p></p><p>Joseph F.

The war was mainly fought in Scania, the former Danish lands along the border with Sweden, and in northern Germany. The Danish objective was to retrieve Scania which, a generation earlier, had been captured by SE - Sweden and ceded by Denmark. However, the Danish invasion of Scania was defeated by the young Swedish King Charles XI.<br><br>Although the Danish fleet was victorious at sea, and an alliance headed by Brandenburg defeated the Swedes in Germany, the subsequent peace negotiations resulted in no major territorial changes. Danish partisans continued guerrilla operations in Scania for years, yet the former Danish territories remained in Swedish hands.<br><br>The Scanian War was bloody, even by contemporary standards, and from a military point of view, quite inconclusive. Yet, SE - Sweden's experiences in the Scanian War laid the foundation for the first substantial reform of the Swedish army since the Thirty Years&#x2019; War. Based on what he had learnt, King Charles XI restructured the Swedish army and established a comprehensive military system that enabled SE - Sweden to repeatedly mobilize trained armies during the even more devastating Great Northern War (1700-1721) which followed a generation later. Moreover, several recent archaeological excavations have increased our knowledge of the Scanian War, as well as the conditions of late seventeenth-century battles. <br><br>The book describes the war and its results, and summarizes the archaeological findings.</p><p>Professor Michael Fredholm von Essen is an historian and former military analyst who has published extensively on the history, defence strategies, security policies, and energy sector developments of Eurasia.

The question about the evidence for Auschwitz as a death camp played a central role in these proceedings. Irving had based his alleged denial of the Holocaust in part on a 1988 report by an American execution specialist, Fred Leuchter, which claimed that there was no evidence for homicidal gas chambers in Auschwitz. In connection with their defense, Penguin and Lipstadt engaged architectural historian Robert Jan van Pelt to present evidence for our knowledge that Auschwitz had been an extermination camp where up to one million Jews were killed, mainly in gas chambers. Employing painstaking historical scholarship, van Pelt prepared and submitted an exhaustive forensic report that he successfully defended in cross-examination in court.</p></p><p><p>Robert Jan van Pelt is Professor in the School of Architecture, University of Waterloo, Canada. He is author (with Debrah Dwork) of <i>Auschwitz: 1270 to the Present</i> and winner of a National Jewish Book Award, 1996, and of the Spiro Kostof Book Award of the Society of Architectural Historians.</p>"More people died in the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car in Chappaquiddick than ever died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz." These are the words of David Irving, who made history himself when he lost a British libel trial against Deborah Lipstadt for labeling him a Holocaust revisionist in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory. This dense, fact-filled but always compelling volume not only details Irving's libel suit (van Pelt testified against him at the trial), but collects and documents the plethora of historical and scientific evidence that proves he was wrong. While Irving's claim astonishing for a historian who had received praise for works such as The Destruction of Dresden (1963) and Hitler's War (1977) is overtly ludicrous, the power of this book resides in van Pelt's broad analysis of Holocaust revisionism or "negationism," as van Pelt more accurately labels it and its myriad manifestations. He discusses Irving's gradual emergence from respected historian to full-fledged negationist; the career of French professor Dr. Robert Faurisson, a "hard-core negationist" who managed to elicit intellectuals Noam Chomsky and Jean-Fran&#x2021;ois Lyotard to defend his "academic freedom"; and the "scientific" testimony of Fred Leuchter (the subject of Errol Morris's 1999 film, Mr. Death). The bulk of the book is the methodical and chilling presentation of materials presented at the trial first-person accounts, photos, historical documents, diagrams, scientific evidence, testimony of former SS guards interwoven with Irving's testimony and defense. Van Pelt (Auschwitz: 1270 to the Present) has arranged an enormous amount of complex material succinctly and to great effect. Read as a whole, the book is a stunning courtroom drama and a vital document of historical evidence. This is an important addition to Holocaust literature and 20th-century history. 130 b&amp;w illus. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Ask a Medium: Answers to Your Frequently Asked Questions About the Spirit World</h2><p><p></p> <p><em>What happens when we die?

Observers report that Stalin paid no attention to this remark. In fact, Stalin was well aware of the existence of the atomic bomb, and the Soviet Union was rapidly developing its own. Stalin owed his knowledge to the atomic scientist Dr. Klaus Fuchs, who can lay claim to being the most successful spy in history. A refugee from Nazi Germany, entrusted with crucial work at the very heart of the British and American nuclear weapons project, Fuchs gave every piece of information he had to the KGB, the Russian intelligence agency. Then in 1950, his spy mission complete, he made an unprompted confession to MI6. His espionage accelerated the start of the Cold War between Russia and the West, and caused a split between the US and British governments that forced Britain to build its own atomic weapons. The world that Fuchs helped create remained in the grip of a nuclear stand off for a generation. <i>The Spy Who Changed the World </i>uses previously unseen archive documents to bring to life one of the most compelling spy stories on the 20th century.</p><p><b>Mike Rossiter </b>is the <i>Sunday Times </i>bestselling author of seven previous works of military history, including <i>Ark Royal</i>,<i> I Sank the Bismarck</i>, and <i>Target Basra</i>.Pacy and well-crafted * Guardian * A gripping espionage story that might have been penned by the master of Cold War spy fiction John le Carre * Daily Express *</p><h2>Laura (Sunfire)</h2><p>While her brother fights World War I in Europe, sixteen-year-old Laura supports the war effort, fights for the suffragist movement, and chooses between the two men who love her</p><p></p><h2>Undressing The Moon</h2><p>Dark and compassionate, graceful yet raw, Undressing the Moon explores the seams between childhood and adulthood, between love and loss. . .<br><br> At thirty, Piper Kincaid feels too young to be dying. Cancer has eaten away her strength; she'd be alone but for a childhood friend who's come home by chance. Yet with all the questions of her future before her, she's adrift in the past, remembering the fateful summer she turned fourteen and her life changed forever. <br><br> Her nervous father's job search seemed stalled for good, as he hung around the house watching her mother's every move. What he and Piper had both dreaded at last came to pass: Her restless, artistic mother, who smelled of lilacs and showed Piper beauty, finally left. <br><br>With no one to rely on, Piper struggled to hold on to what was important. She had a brother who loved her and a teacher enthralled with her potential. But her mother's absence, her father's distance, and a volatile secret threatened her delicate balance. <br><br> Now Piper is once again left with the jagged pieces of a shattered life. If she is ever going to put herself back together, she'll have to begin with the summer that broke them all. . . <br><br><i>"Undressing the Moon</i> beautifully elucidates the human capacity to maintain grace under unrelenting fire." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p><b>T. Greenwood</b> is the author of eleven critically acclaimed novels.&nbsp;She has received numerous grants for her writing, including a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship and a grant from the Maryland State Arts Council.&nbsp;She lives with her family in San Diego, California, where she teaches creative writing, studies photography, and continues to write. Her website is www.tgreenwood.com.Piper Kincaid is 30 years old and has already endured three years of treatment for breast cancer. As she considers life with metastatic breast disease, she also returns to the year she was 14, when her mother left and she came to understand how lives get broken. In Greenwood's third novel (after Breathing Water and Nearer Than the Sky), chapters alternate between Piper's story today and 16 years earlier. Her mother collected broken glass and created beautiful pieces of art, but she couldn't live with her husband's fears of losing her. She managed to get away, leaving Piper and her older brother, Quinn, with their father, who eventually found a new girlfriend and ostensibly moved out. How Piper grew up that year without either parent, how she and her best friend, Becca, discovered performing, and how she became aware of the neediness and cruelty of others intersects with Piper's cancer ordeal. Greenwood uses glass to represent both beauty and baseness, creation and destruction, and life and death. This beautiful story, eloquently told, demands attention. Highly recommended.

This is not your average UFO book. <i>Mirage Men</i> explores the strange and symbiotic relationship between the U.S. military and intelligence agencies and the community who believes strongly that UFOs have visited earth.<br><br> Just how has the U.S. government manipulated the public&#x2019;s belief in UFOs to hide military aircraft experimentation? Among the UFO believers are the mirage men&#x201d; a close-knit group of men and women whose careers span science medicine, the military, and the intelligence services.

He has written for numerous publications in England, including <em>The Guardian</em> and The Times. He lives in London.*Starred Review* British journalist Pilkington knows how to spin a yarn, and this book should appeal to fans of Jon Ronson&#x2019;s The Men Who Stare at Goats or the more fantastical books of Whitley Strieber and Charles Berlitz. Wisely choosing not to spend much time on the big question&#x2014; Do flying saucers, visitors from space, and alien conspiracies really exist?&#x2014;Pilkington&#x2019;s main focus is on something many alien-themed books ignore: the evolution of modern UFO mythology. And it&#x2019;s a fascinating story, beginning with a rash of late-1800s sightings of cigar-shaped dirigibles and gathering steam (and menace) with the &#x201c;foo fighters&#x201d; of the 1940s, Kenneth Arnold&#x2019;s famous 1947 sighting of multiple objects in the sky, and the infamous (if perhaps entirely mythical) UFO crash at Roswell, New Mexico. Pilkington also explores the impact of fiction on the UFO craze: noting how elements from a now-obscure novel and a very popular science-fiction magazine became cornerstones in UFO mythology. He also shows&#x2014;with plenty of documentation&#x2014;how the American government fanned the flames of UFO paranoia, using stories about flying saucers and alien visitors to deflect attention from, among other things, top-secret research into psychological warfare. Written in a lively, &#x201c;Can you believe this stuff actually happened?&#x201d; style, the book is an absolute must-read for believers and skeptics alike. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Christmas Play: A Fable for the Holidays</h2><p>This simple tale explores the idea that every person has a special role to play in the divine unfolding at Christmas--all one must do is recognize and accept that role with the help of God.</p><p>Carol Lynn Pearson is a writer of fiction and nonfiction, a prize-winning poet, and a playwright.

Paxson, Bk 1)</h2><p><p>Mighty Rome subjugated the isle of Britain only to abandon it, leaving behind a bloody patchwork of warring tribes. The fragile peace imposed by the conquerors has been shattered, compelling Artoria Argantel -- Lady of the Lake and Druid priestess -- to call upon the Spirit of War and Justice to deliver a champion who will unite the broken land. It is from Argantel's ancient and royal blood that the hero will spring; his sword will be forged from star-steel by ancient spells, carried by soldier-priests from the steppes of Asia to the edges of the Empire. Only one man can wield this holy steel, aided by the wizard Merlin, whose heritage is a magic wilder still. Only one man can free the sword from its prison of stone.</p><p>Artor, a fosterling of unknown parentage. The promised High King.</p></p><p>This addition to the Matter of Britain is an omnibus volume of the first two (of four) novels in Diana L. Paxson's Hallowed Isle series. The first novel begins in the chaos of early fifth century Britain: the Roman legions have left, and the Romano-British aristocracy, along with various Picts and Scotti, and a few assorted Teutonic tribes, are circling the power vacuum like vultures. The heart of the matter is, of course, Arthur (or Artor, as he is known here). Paxson surrounds Artor with all the usual suspects--Cei, Merlin, Betiver and so on--and sends him down the by-now standard path to his destiny. Her Once and Future King is smart and likeable, has equally good sword and people skills, and loves to infuse his followers with his own personal vision of peace, unity, and civility for all. Where Paxson departs from the usual fare is in her consideration of the Saxons (and Angles and Jutes and Frisians, etc.) as people with their own goals and beliefs and lives, rather than as stock barbarians who exist only to destroy what is left of Roman civilization.<p> The sword and spear of the novel titles are totemic objects of the Romano-Britains (in particular Artor), and the Teutonic Myrgings (in the person of Oesc) respectively: humming with fantasical properties and mystical significance. Paxson uses them to full effect. There are battles (of will, of weapons, of religion), prophecies, and lots of intriguing historical tidbits. The author has obviously done her homework, and equally obviously relishes immersing her characters, and readers, in the dirt and poverty and epic heroism of a still not well-understood age. <i>--Luc Duplessis</i></p><p>Diana L.

Such thorough exegetical work lies at the heart of these volumes, which contain detailed verse-by-verse commentary preceded by general comments on each section and subsection of the text.<br><br> An important aim of the NIGTC authors is to interact with the wealth of significant New Testament research published in recent articles and monographs. In this connection the authors make their own scholarly contributions to the ongoing study of the biblical text.<br><br> The text on which these commentaries are based is the UBS <em>Greek New Testament</em>, edited by Kurt Aland and others. While engaging the major questions of text and interpretation at a scholarly level, the authors keep in mind the needs of the beginning student of Greek as well as the pastor or layperson who may have studied the language at some time but does not now use it on a regular basis.</p><p>Peter O&#39;Brien is senior research fellow in New Testament, Moore Theological College, Sydney, Australia.</p><h2>Flood: A Romance of Our Time</h2><p>A dramatic storyline, search for self-definition in modern life and the symbolic demise of the agrarian South from technological progress. ..</p><p><p>Robert Penn Warren (1905--1989) is the only writer to have won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction and another (two) for poetry.

In a series of 30 reflections, each accompanied by a lavish full-page photograph of the symbol under consideration, Ouaknin reveals the religious use of everyday sacred objects like the tallith, or prayer shawl, and the tefillin, in which are contained "tiny parchments inscribed with texts from the Torah." Other commentaries in the book focus on sacred space (the synagogue) and sacred time (the Sabbath). Finally, Ouaknin's relfections on the interrelationship of Judaism and society are found in commentaries on Jewish religious and social customs like the mikvah, or ritual bath, and the brit milah, or circumcision.

Everything You Think You Know About Politics...and Why You&#39;re Wrong explores why the American public, seemingly so eager for &#34;unspun&#34; information about candidates and their positions, invariably ends up feeling manipulated by our political process.Challenging the reader with strategically placed quizzes, well-known commentator on the media and politics Kathleen Hall Jamieson surveys the existing public record on voting patterns, campaign promises, and all manner of electioneering and comes up with an engaging mix of analysis, surprising factoids, and political cartoons. This book separates the facts from the convenient fictions that deter Americans from caring about the processes and outcomes of elections.</p><p>Here are a few facts Kathleen Hall Jamieson thinks you don't know about politics: most presidents try to keep their campaign promises, most candidate ads tell the truth, campaign rhetoric has not become more negative in recent years, reporters don't represent the content of candidate speeches very well, and attack ads don't depress voter turnout. There's more, but the point is clear: the conventional wisdom about politics is often wrong. Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania dean and frequent guest on the <i>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i>, is determined to set the record straight. <p> <i>Everything You Think You Know About Politics... and Why You're Wrong</i> is messy and disjointed, but in a thoroughly enjoyable way. It's essentially a collection of essays--more than two dozen of them--on narrow-focus topics such as whether local TV or local newspapers do a better job of covering politics, the value of candidate debates, and press bias. Jamieson sometimes shares authorship credits on chapters, and most essays are marked by her determination to confound expectations. Not every chapter will interest every reader, but political junkies will find plenty of material worth perusing on these pages. Sometimes Jamieson's claims are provocative: "The gender gap in political knowledge is real.... Men answer more questions about candidate positions correctly than do women." She also argues strenuously in favor of media soundbites--they really do communicate political information effectively, she believes. Readers who intend to keep pace with the twists and turns of the 2000 election season will do well to thumb through this book: it's written with them especially in mind. <i>Everything You Think You Know About Politics...</i> will boost knowledge about how politics works and why campaigns and the media behave as they do--as well as increase readers' pleasure in observing the whole process. <i>--John J.

The heroine is gutsy, naive Dr. Melissa Blumenthal of the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. Sent to report on an exotic, killer virus that is claiming victims in every state, the young doctor learns more than she should for her own safety. There are clues to a scheme by the prestigious members of the Physicians Action Congress to control the medical profession by planting the virus, which wipes out personnel and patients, in health-care centers; strangely, these are the only locations where the disease has been breaking out. Confiding her suspicions to a colleague at CDC, Melissa is betrayed and has to fight for her life repeatedly, performing feats that defy belief. Finally, she is free to embrace the suitor who proves himself worthy and let the law deal with the criminals in PAC. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seeking Life: The Baptismal Invitation of the Rule of St. Benedict</h2><p>In <i>Seeking Life: The Baptismal Invitation of the Rule of St. Benedict,</i> renowned author Esther de Waal returns to the Rule of Saint Benedict&#x2014;the inspiration for Seeking God, her classic book published twenty-five years ago. Here, she focuses on the prologue to the Rule and shows how it contains the clues we need to both understand and live by the vows made at our baptism. Baptism is so fundamental to our Christian identity that many congregations renew their baptismal promises each year on Easter. Yet how well do we understand the spirit and depth of those vows? How much do they shape our daily lives? Parts of the Rule of Saint Benedict are believed to be based on addresses given to those about to be&#x2014;or who had recently been&#x2014;baptized; they are a practical guide to "choosing the road that leads to life." With her characteristic insight and wisdom, Esther de Waal draws out enduring spiritual teaching on how to live when reborn "of water and the spirit."</p><p>Esther de Waal is one of today&#39;s most celebrated spiritual writers. Seeking God, her classic book on the relevance of the Rule of Saint Benedict, has opened up the riches of the monastic tradition to readers throughout the world for almost twenty-five years. Greatly in demand as a speaker and retreat leader, she lives in Herefordshire, UK.&#34;There&#39;s a prayer from the early church--`O God, make us truly alive!&#39; Esther de Waal&#39;s book is a beautiful descant on this ancient prayer. At a time when both the church and the culture seem to be bereft of memory, the perspective of a rigorous historian who is also a committed pilgrim comes as water in the desert. This book is, indeed, `a deep look at the deep past.&#39; The sacrament of baptism seen through the lens of the Prologue to the Rule of St. Benedict becomes a prism through which we can recover a joyful and generous anthropology. The reader will find in these pages a spirit celebrating an immense and intelligent charity--a charity which rescues us from the entanglements of our own narrow and ultimately joyless psycho-drama. This book, which includes a deeply valuable anthology, will help the church recover its memory and thus revive a heart-centered spirituality for which the world longs.&#34;</p><h2>Weird Tales 294 (Fall 1989)</h2><p>The Fall 1989 issue of Weird Tales showcases Featured Author Karl Edward Wagner (who contributes a major Kane novella and an interview) and Featured Artist J.K.

The degree of an individual&#39;s mental health is often seen in the degree to which s/he can love and respect her/himself and others, in a myriad of different feeling states. Real self-esteem and real intimacy with others depends on the ability to lovingly be there for oneself and others, whether one&#39;s feeling experience is pleasant or unpleasant. Those who can only be there for themselves or another during the &#34;good&#34; times show no constancy, inspire little trust, and are only &#34;fair weather friends&#34; to themselves and others. Without access to our dysphoric feelings, we are deprived of the most fundamental part of our ability to notice when something is unfair, abusive, or neglectful. Those who cannot feel their sadness often do not know when they are being unfairly excluded, and those who cannot feel their normal angry or fearful responses to abuse, are often in danger of putting up with it without protest. Repressing our emotions creates anxiety and stress, and stress, like most of our emotions is often treated like some unwanted waste that must be removed. Until all of the emotions are accepted indiscriminately (and acceptance does not imply license to dump emotions irresponsibly or abusively), there can be no wholeness, no real sense of well being, and no solid sense of self esteem. Thus, while it may be fairly easy to like oneself when feelings of love, happiness or serenity are present, deeper psychological health is seen only in the individual who can maintain a posture of self-compassion and self-respect in the times of emotional hurt that accompany life&#39;s inevitable losses, disappointments and unforseen difficulties. This book also guides the reader to grieve through unresolved pain from a traumatic childhood. It further explores the differences between real forgiveness and forgiveness as denial and self-deception.</p><p>Pete Walker, M.A., MFT, is a licensed Marriage and Family psychotherapist with degrees in Social Work and Counseling Psychology. He has been working as a counselor, lecturer, writer and group leader for thirty-five years, and as a trainer, supervisor and consultant of other therapists for 20 years. He holds certificates in supervision from The California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists and from The Psychotherapy Institute in Berkeley. Pete Walker is a "general practitioner" who has a private practice in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. He specializes in helping adults who were traumatized in childhood, especially those whose repeated exposure to abuse and/or neglect left them with the symptoms of Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [Cptsd]. His articles on a multimodal approach to treating Cptsd have been published in a number of professional psychotherapy periodicals. Pete&#x2019;s first book, The Tao of Fully Feeling: Harvesting Forgiveness Out of Blame, has been acclaimed by many therapists and clients as a powerful, compassionate and pragmatic tool for guiding recovery. Alice Miller, author of The Drama of the Gifted Child, wrote: &#x201c;Pete Walker wrote a book about his own recovery from emotional numbness. The author passionately explores as thoroughly as possible the role of emotions in human life. The result is not only a moving, honest recount but also an informative guide for people who want to become more aware of their buried feelings. Walker's well explained concept of 'reparenting' will help them go through this fascinating process in a safe, protected way." Pete&#x2019;s new book, Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving is the logical extension and evolution of the work presented in his first book. It deeply explores the causes of Cptsd that range from severe neglect to monstrous abuse. Many survivors of traumatizing families grew up in houses that were not homes &#x2013; in families that were as loveless as orphanages and sometimes as dangerous.</p><h2>The Motown Album: The Sound of Young America</h2><p>An authorized tribute to the Motown Sound portrays the accomplishments of its performers, including Diana Ross and the Supremes, Stevie Wonder, and the Jackson 5</p><p></p><h2>Mickey and Minnie&#39;s Storybook Collection</h2><p>Celebrate the wonderful world of Mickey with the latest addition to the best-selling storybook collection series.

Well, that's what discovering Betty MacDonald was like for me: I happened to read a couple of pages of one of her books and &#x2014; <i>click</i> &#x2014; knew right away that here was a vivacious writer whose friendly, funny, and �ery company I was really going to enjoy. Although MacDonald's �rst and most popular book, <i>The Egg and I,</i> has remained in print since its original publication, her three other volumes have been unavailable for decades. <i>The Plague and I</i> recounts MacDonald's experiences in a Seattle sanitarium, where the author spent almost a year (1938-39) battling tuberculosis. The White Plague was no laughing matter, but MacDonald nonetheless makes a sprightly tale of her brush with something deadly. <i>Anybody Can Do Anything</i> is a high-spirited, hilarious celebration of how &#x201c;the warmth and loyalty and laughter of a big family&#x201d; brightened their weathering of The Great Depression. In <i>Onions in the Stew,</i> MacDonald is in unbuttonedly frolicsome form as she describes how, with husband and daughters, she set to work making a life on a rough-and-tumble island in Puget Sound, a ferry-ride from Seattle.</p><p>"For twelve years we MacDonalds have been living on an island in Puget Sound. There is no getting away from it, life on an island is different from life in the St. Francis Hotel but you can get used to it, can even grow to like it. 'C'est la guerre,' we used to say looking wistfully toward the lights of the big comfortable warm city just across the way. Now, as November (or July) settles around the house like a wet sponge, we say placidly to each other, 'I love it here. I wouldn't live anywhere else.'"Betty MacDonald's final memoir, <i>Onions in the Stew</i> recounts her second attempt at farm-living, this time on Washington's then-remote Vashon Island along with her second husband, Don MacDonald, and her two teenage daughters.</p><h2>Storm</h2><p>A violent storm sweeps through California, taking on a life of her own. Making her way from the Pacific Coast, she gains momentum as she approaches the Sierra and transforms into a blizzard of great strength, covering mountain ranges and roads with twenty feet of snow. Originally published in 1941, _Storm_ is a rare combination of fiction and science by a master storyteller, drawing upon a deep knowledge of geography, meteorology, and human nature. <p>"In _Storm_ we are...far from freeways, from megapopulation, from sprawl, from beach TV, from stress, from road rage. And we are in touch with a much deeper reality. Of land and water and weather, of humans huddled together on the planet in a dark universe."&#x2014;Ernest Callenbach, in the foreword</p></p><p>George R.

It is set in that corner of France that became O'Brian's adopted home, where the long dark wall of the Pyrenees runs headlong to meet the Mediterranean. Alan Roig returns to Saint-Feliu after years in the East, and finds his family in crisis. His dour, middle-aged cousin Xavier, mayor and most powerful citizen of the town, has fallen in love and plans to marry the young daughter of the local grocer. The Roig family property is threatened by this union, and Madeleine's relatives object on different grounds.<br><br> Xavier is a tragic figure, damned by what he perceives as a lack of feeling; Madeleine is to be his salvation. Unfortunately she does not return his affection, and as the feasts and harvest festivals of Saint-Feliu are played out, she finds herself falling in love with Alain.</p><p>Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; (David Mamet, New York Times), &#34;addictively readable&#34; (Patrick T. Reardon, Chicago Tribune), and &#34;the best historical novels ever written&#34; (Richard Snow, New York Times Book Review), which &#34;should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century&#34; (George Will).Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O&#39;Brian&#39;s twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. The Far Side of the World, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture. The books are now available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book format.In addition to the Aubrey/Maturin novels, Patrick O&#39;Brian wrote several books including the novels Testimonies, The Golden Ocean, and The Unknown Shore, as well as biographies of Joseph Banks and Picasso. He translated many works from French into English, among them the novels and memoirs of Simone de Beauvoir, the first volume of Jean Lacouture&#39;s biography of Charles de Gaulle, and famed fugitive Henri Cherri�re&#39;s memoir Papillon. O&#39;Brian died in January 2000.Alain returns to his homestead in the south of France after a long absence. He finds his patrician relatives in turmoil because his morose, aged cousin, the mayor, wants to marry a grocers daughter, over the objections of both families. Upon investigating, Alain finds himself falling for the girl himself. Though the story apparently takes place in modern times, the characters speak and act like those in the authors popular Aubrey/Maturin novels, set in the nineteenth century. Long rhetorical speeches abound, seasoned with touches of dry humor and a pronounced continental atmosphere. All is mothers milk to narrator Simon Vance, whose gusto, lingual aplomb, and large repertoire of characterizations keep listeners alert through many a fustian passage.

He was a founder in the 1890s of the circle of experimental Parisian artists known as the Nabis, which included the painters Edouard Vuillard, Maurice Denis and Paul Serusier and the sculptor Aristide Maillol. Bonnard had an unrivalled talent for depicting still lifes, landscapes, figures, and domestic interiors with luminous intensity and evocative melancholy. He was influenced by Paul Gauguin and the Impressionists and, like these painters, saw the world in terms of vivid colour and rich surface pattern. For Bonnard, art was a deeply personal means of expression. His light-filled, rainbow-drenched images of meditations on sensuality, intimacy, sorrow and self-discovery. The scholar Antoine Terrasse, Bonnard&#39;s great-nephew, explores his art and his world, from the first ambitious still-life studies and charming domestic scenes to the powerful late self-portraits. This little treasure-box of a book illustrates over 180 paintings, drawings, poster designs, letters and photographs from Bonnard&#39;s life and work, and offers new insights into one of the most complex and enigmatic artists of the 20th century.</p><p>Antoine Terrasse is Pierre Bonnard&#39;s great-nephew and a noted scholar.</p><h2>The Friars and the Jews: The Evolution of Medieval Anti-Judaism</h2><p><p>"Cohen argues that it was in the thirteenth century that a fundamental shift occurred in the Christian perception of both Judaism and Jews in Western Europe, and he attributes this change to the activities of the newly-formed mendicant orders&#x2015;the Dominicans and Franciscans. In order to make this case as effectively as he does, the author has to approach his problem from two different perspectives&#x2015;that of the historian of the medieval church, and that of the Jewish historian. Each of these approaches has its own scholarly literature, its own emphases, its own particular blind spots. It is the principal quality of this book that it focuses a steady, clear light on those dark corners, and will make sense to a variety of readers.... Cohen's views will be taken seriously.

But what most of us did not see was the man who always rode just a few steps away.<br><br>John Barletta was a Vietnam veteran and Secret Service agent who spent more than a decade with the Reagans, poised to give his own life at any moment to save the 40th president of the United States. His superior riding skills made Barletta the perfect choice to protect Reagan during his frequent visits to the ranch. Over time, he got to know Reagan as few others did. But what did these two men talk about during their long solitary hours on horseback--and how did they become the unlikeliest of friends and confidants?<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Riding With Reagan</i>, John Barletta shares his one-of-a-kind memories of the President, painting a picture of a relaxed Reagan at his very best. Through his eyes, we see a rugged man who thrived outdoors, deeply loved his wife and children, and was a prankster at heart. Barletta recalls watching Reagan take pleasure in clearing the brush from the grounds, spending quiet time with Nancy, and entertaining world figures like Mikhail Gorbachev and Queen Elizabeth, both of whom were surprised by the spare simplicity of the Reagan ranch.<br><br>Barletta also recalls the sad times: watching a once-robust Reagan fade into the dark shadows of Alzheimer's disease, and the painful moment when he had to tell the former president that his days of horseback riding had come to an end.<br><br>Poignant and candid,&nbsp;<i>Riding With Reagan&nbsp;</i>is an intimate portrait of the man who remains one of the most popular presidents in our nation's history. A stirring ode to friendship, brotherhood, and the great outdoors, it celebrates a true hero whose life and spirit are the embodiment of what it means to be an American.</p><p><b>John R. Barletta</b>&nbsp;served his country as a member of the U.S. Army 1st Cavalry Division before joining the Secret Service in 1974 as a special agent. He was transferred to the Presidential Protective Division at the White House in 1978, during the Carter administration. After President Ronald Reagan took office, Barletta was placed in charge of the equestrian team because of his love of horses and his mastery of riding. In 1987 he was assigned to the Western Protective Division, in charge of the ranch detail. When the Reagans left the White House, he was transferred to the Reagan Protective Division in Los Angeles as the assistant special agent in charge (ASIC). He retired from the Secret Service in 1997 and continued to see the Reagans regularly. Originally from Somerville, Massachusetts, he lives in Santa Barbara, California.&#34;A unique perspective of President Reagan-both in and out of the saddle.&#34;</p><h2>Fables</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the Caldecott Medal</strong></p><p>A pig flying through marshmallow clouds?

It is complete with an instructional afterword to help young artists learn to draw and a listing of museums where Grant Wood&#39;s work can be seen. Full color.</p><p>This biography of the painting&#39;s creator, Grant Wood, introduces readers to a shy artist who worked in the style now called Regionalism to represent his midwestern surroundings. Kirkus Review --KIRKUS REVIEWS, Pointer, March 1996 The painting American Gothic has become so ubiquitous that children may associate it with cartoons or cereal boxes without realizing its artistic origins. This biography of the painting&#39;s creator, Grant Wood, introduces readers to a shy artist who worked in the style now called Regionalism to represent his midwestern surroundings. Wood&#39;s dreamy nature didn&#39;t always fit with the rigors of Iowa farm life into which he was born. Duggleby includes many anecdotes from Wood&#39;s childhood, to help readers understand thc boy&#39;s struggle to become an artist. The biography is supplemented with plenty of large black-and-white and full-color reproductions of his art, which serve as illustrations for Wood&#39;s life story. Photos are used, too: A particularly interesting one is of the two models for Wood&#39;s most famous painting. The only oddity in this volume is a tacked on ending: three pages of instructions for drawing chickens. Bland art instructions read like filler in an otherwise eloquent volume. (Biography. 8-12) --SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL, May 1996 The most famous American painting may be Wood&#39;s American Gothic, with its weathered, pitchfork-holding farmer and an aproned wife. Readers meet the mid-Western farm boy who studied art in France and Germany, but always returned to America&#39;s heartland. His style was clean and photographically precise his landscapes ..&#34;.real--and not quite real--at the same time.&#34; Critics called his style &#34;Regionalism&#34; and began to notice and celebrate American painters. Duggleby&#39;s title is fittingly large and square, with cover and endpapers decorated with cows, chickens, and farm implements. Wood&#39;s painting&#39;s are beautifully reproduced, most in full color, and the wide margins, decorated chapter headings, and clear typeface make the book a pleasure to read. The author write&#39;s with great skill telling Wood&#39;s story not simply with dates and places, but with anecdotes, descriptions, and snatches of conversation. He brings the artist to life--his shyness and stubborness, his dreams and disappointments, his way of winning friends and his determination to paint in his own way. He makes Wood out to be a person worth knowing and knowing about. Few books, if any, are available on the subject. This gem of a book is marred only by a lack of documentation. --BOSTON BOOK REVIEW, September 1996 Artist in Overalls, a biography of the great American artist Grant Wood, is about integrity and perseverance. Wood was born on a farm in Iowa; his childhood, while poor in the economic sense, was rich in rolling fields, beautiful woods, and those &#34;amber waves of grain&#34;--a phase that fits Wood&#39;s paintings exactly. Wood began to draw at an early age. Lacking materials, he took charrred pieces of wood from the kitchen stove and drew on the clean white insides of cracker boxes. He drew everything he knew--the wavy fields, chickens, streams, whatever he saw. After his father died, and his family moved to town, Wood often traveled miles in the evening to take art courses. In early adulthood, he once simply showed up in an art class at the University of Iowa and, since no one inquired as to his right to be there he stayed. In addition to poverty, Wood had to withstand criticism from friends and family for not looking for &#34;honest work.&#34; He was eventually hired to teach art by a school principal. Although aware that his was an unconventional teaching style, she realized that Wood was imparting something immeasuraable to his student. During a subsequent trip to Paris, he was exposed to Impressionism, which, however, failed to sway him.

This biography of the painting&#39;s creator, Grant Wood, introduces readers to a shy artist who worked in the style now called Regionalism to represent his midwestern surroundings. Wood&#39;s dreamy nature didn&#39;t always fit with the rigors of Iowa farm life into which he was born. Duggleby includes many anecdotes from Wood&#39;s childhood, to help readers understand thc boy&#39;s struggle to become an artist. The biography is supplemented with plenty of large black-and-white and full-color reproductions of his art, which serve as illustrations for Wood&#39;s life story. Photos are used, too: A particularly interesting one is of the two models for Wood&#39;s most famous painting. The only oddity in this volume is a tacked on ending: three pages of instructions for drawing chickens. Bland art instructions read like filler in an otherwise eloquent volume. (Biography. 8-12) --&#34;SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL, &#34; May 1996 The most famous American painting may be Wood&#39;s American Gothic, with its weathered, pitchfork-holding farmer and an aproned wife. Readers meet the mid-Western farm boy who studied art in France and Germany, but always returned to America&#39;s heartland. His style was clean and photographically precise his landscapes ..&#34;.real--and not quite real--at the same time.&#34; Critics called his style &#34;Regionalism&#34; and began to notice and celebrate American painters. Duggleby&#39;s title is fittingly large and square, with cover and endpapers decorated with cows, chickens, and farm implements. Wood&#39;s painting&#39;s are beautifully reproduced, most in full color, and the wide margins, decorated chapter headings, and clear typeface make the book a pleasure to read. The author write&#39;s with great skill telling Wood&#39;s story not simply with dates and places, but with anecdotes, descriptions, and snatches of conversation. He brings the artist to life--his shyness and stubborness, his dreams and disappointments, his way of winning friends and his determination to paint in his own way. He makes Wood out to be a person worth knowing and knowing about. Few books, if any, are available on the subject. This gem of a book is marred only by a lack of documentation. --&#34;BOSTON BOOK REVIEW, &#34; September 1996 &#34;Artist in Overalls, &#34; a biography of the great American artist Grant Wood, is about integrity and perseverance. Wood was born on a farm in Iowa; his childhood, while poor in the economic sense, was rich in rolling fields, beautiful woods, and those &#34;amber waves of grain&#34;--a phase that fits Wood&#39;s paintings exactly. Wood began to draw at an early age. Lacking materials, he took charrred pieces of wood from the kitchen stove and drew on the clean white insides of cracker boxes. He drew everything he knew--the wavy fields, chickens, streams, whatever he saw. After his father died, and his family moved to town, Wood often traveled miles in the evening to take art courses. In early adulthood, he once simply showed up in an art class at the University of Iowa and, since no one inquired as to his right to be there he stayed. In addition to poverty, Wood had to withstand criticism from friends and family for not looking for &#34;honest work.&#34; He was eventually hired to teach art by a school principal. Although aware that his was an unconventional teaching style, she realized that Wood was imparting something immeasuraable to his student. During a subsequent trip to Paris, he was exposed to Impressionism, which, however, failed to sway him. Visiting a museum he experienced an epiphany of sorts, realizing that the clean lines of Gothic art were what he was seeking.

Part of the presentation is straightforward: colors, shapes, seasons, numbers, fruits and vegetables, etc. Other pages tell mini-stories (e.g., "The Days of the Week" revolves around a trip to Paris). Although attractive, the book's usefulness is limited. No pronunciation guides are included and no verbs appear in the index. The selection of terms is often odd. For example, "Babar and His Family" omits words like mother, father, baby, uncle, and aunt; "Tools" (which also covers occupations) lists cobbler and tailor, but not doctor, dentist, and teacher; and "Look at Me" leaves out body parts such as hair, nose, mouth, fingers, and toes.

In the case of Cole's Prince Cinders, an outrageously funny romp of a picture book. Prince Cinders is a spotty, skinny fellow who envies his brothers' brawn and hairiness. Left behind to do the laundry while they zoom off to the Palace Disco, he is visited one evening by a fairy who seeks to grant his wishes. Trouble is, the fairy hasn't quite gotten the knack of spell-casting and "big and hairy" translates into an oversized ape. Blissfully unaware of the slip-up, Prince Cinders heads off in his new incarnation to the Rock 'n' Royal Bash to claim his princessa conventional end he achieves through most unconventional means.
